But\nfor the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into\nhis own delicate and \ufb01nely adjusted temperament was\nto introduce a distracting factor which might throw a\ndoubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power\nlenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong\nemotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was\nbut one woman to him, and that woman was the late\nIrene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had\ndrifted us away from each other. My own complete\nhappiness, and the home-centred interests which rise\nup around the man who \ufb01rst \ufb01nds himself master of\nhis own establishment, were suf\ufb01cient to absorb all\nmy attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form\nof society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained\nin our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between\ncocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug,\nand the \ufb01erce energy of his own keen nature. He was\nstill, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary\npowers of observation in following out those clues,\nand clearing up those mysteries which had been aban-\ndoned as hopeless by the of\ufb01cial police. From time\nto time I heard some vague account of his doings:\nof his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff\nmurder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of\nthe Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and \ufb01nally of\nthe mission which he had accomplished so delicately\nand successfully for the reigning family of Holland.\nBeyond these signs of his activity, however, which I\nmerely shared with all the readers of the daily press,\nI knew little of my former friend and companion.\nOne night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March,\n1888\u2014I was returning from a journey to a patient\n(for I had now returned to civil practice), when my\nway led me through Baker Street.

As I passed the\nwell-remembered door, which must always be associ-\nated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark\nincidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he\nwas employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms\nwere brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw\nhis tall, spare \ufb01gure pass twice in a dark silhouette\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,\neagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his\nhands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his\nevery mood and habit, his attitude and manner told\ntheir own story. He was at work again. He had risen\nout of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the\nscent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was\nshown up to the chamber which had formerly been\nin part my own.\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but\nhe was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word\nspoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an\narmchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indi-\ncated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then\nhe stood before the \ufb01re and looked me over in his\nsingular introspective fashion.\n\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI think, Wat-\nson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds\nsince I saw you.\u201d\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.\n\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more. Just\na tri\ufb02e more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I\nobserve. You did not tell me that you intended to go\ninto harness.\u201d\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it.

Obviously they have been caused by\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the\nedges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud\nfrom it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that\nyou had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the\nLondon slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman\nwalks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a\nblack mark of nitrate of silver upon his right fore\ufb01n-\nger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to\nshow where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must\nbe dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an\nactive member of the medical profession.\u201d\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which\nhe explained his process of deduction. \u201cWhen I hear\nyou give your reasons,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthe thing always\nappears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could\neasily do it myself, though at each successive instance\nof your reasoning I am baf\ufb02ed until you explain your\nprocess.

Sit down in that armchair,\nDoctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard\nupon the stairs and in the passage, paused immedi-\nately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\nauthoritative tap.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.\nA man entered who could hardly have been less\nthan six feet six inches in height, with the chest and\nlimbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness\nwhich would, in England, be looked upon as akin to\nbad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed\nacross the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted\ncoat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown\nover his shoulders was lined with \ufb02ame-coloured\nsilk and secured at the neck with a brooch which con-\nsisted of a single \ufb02aming beryl. Boots which extended\nhalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at\nthe tops with rich brown fur, completed the impres-\nsion of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his\nwhole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat\nin his hand, while he wore across the upper part of\nhis face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black\nvizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that\nvery moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he\nentered. From the lower part of the face he appeared\nto be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging\nlip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution\npushed to the length of obstinacy.\n\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh\nvoice and a strongly marked German accent. \u201cI told\nyou that I would call.\u201d He looked from one to the\nother of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThis is my friend\nand colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good\nenough to help me in my cases.

The landlady in-\nformed me that he had left the house shortly after\neight o\u2019clock in the morning. I sat down beside the\n\ufb01re, however, with the intention of awaiting him, how-\never long he might be. I was already deeply inter-\nested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded\nby none of the grim and strange features which were\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already\nrecorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted\nstation of his client gave it a character of its own. In-\ndeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which\nmy friend had on hand, there was something in his\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive\nreasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study\nhis system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle\nmethods by which he disentangled the most inextrica-\nble mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable\nsuccess that the very possibility of his failing had\nceased to enter into my head.\nIt was close upon four before the door opened,\nand a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-\nwhiskered, with an in\ufb02amed face and disreputable\nclothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was\nto my friend\u2019s amazing powers in the use of disguises,\nI had to look three times before I was certain that\nit was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the\nbedroom, whence he emerged in \ufb01ve minutes tweed-\nsuited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands\ninto his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of\nthe \ufb01re and laughed heartily for some minutes.\n\u201cWell, really!\u201d he cried, and then he choked and\nlaughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp\nand helpless, in the chair.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite too funny.

Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room\non the right side, well furnished, with long windows\nalmost to the \ufb02oor, and those preposterous English\nwindow fasteners which a child could open. Behind\nthere was nothing remarkable, save that the passage\nwindow could be reached from the top of the coach-\nhouse. I walked round it and examined it closely from\nevery point of view, but without noting anything else\nof interest.\n\u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I\nexpected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs\ndown by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers\na hand in rubbing down their horses, and received\nin exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two\n\ufb01lls of shag tobacco, and as much information as I\ncould desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a\ndozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I\nwas not in the least interested, but whose biographies\nI was compelled to listen to.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down in\nthat part.

When I had listened to all they had to tell,\nI began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once\nmore, and to think over my plan of campaign.\n\u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important\nfactor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded\nominous. What was the relation between them, and\nwhat the object of his repeated visits? Was she his\nclient, his friend, or his mistress?

It was already\ndusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we\npaced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting\nfor the coming of its occupant. The house was just\nsuch as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\u2019 suc-\ncinct description, but the locality appeared to be less\nprivate than I expected. On the contrary, for a small\nstreet in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably\nanimated. There was a group of shabbily dressed\nmen smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-\ngrinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were\n\ufb02irting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed\nyoung men who were lounging up and down with\ncigars in their mouths.\n\u201cYou see,\u201d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and\nfro in front of the house, \u201cthis marriage rather sim-\npli\ufb01es matters. The photograph becomes a double-\nedged weapon now. The chances are that she would\nbe as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Nor-\nton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his\nprincess.

Now the question is\u2014Where are we to \ufb01nd\nthe photograph?\u201d\n\u201cWhere, indeed?\u201d\n\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with\nher. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment\nabout a woman\u2019s dress. She knows that the King is\ncapable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may\ntake it, then, that she does not carry it about with\nher.\u201d\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\n\u201cHer banker or her lawyer. There is that dou-\nble possibility. But I am inclined to think neither.\nWomen are naturally secretive, and they like to do\ntheir own secreting. Why should she hand it over\nto anyone else? She could trust her own guardian-\nship, but she could not tell what indirect or political\nin\ufb02uence might be brought to bear upon a business\nman. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use\nit within a few days. It must be where she can lay her\nhands upon it.

Irene Adler, as I will\nstill call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood\nat the top with her superb \ufb01gure outlined against the\nlights of the hall, looking back into the street.\n\u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cHe is dead,\u201d cried several voices.\n\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201d shouted another. \u201cBut\nhe\u2019ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brave fellow,\u201d said a woman. \u201cThey would\nhave had the lady\u2019s purse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been\nfor him.

Af-\nter all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but\npreventing her from injuring another.\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw\nhim motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid\nrushed across and threw open the window. At the\nsame instant I saw him raise his hand and at the sig-\nnal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of\n\u201cFire!\u201d The word was no sooner out of my mouth\nthan the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\nill\u2014gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids\u2014joined\nin a general shriek of \u201cFire!\u201d Thick clouds of smoke\ncurled through the room and out at the open window.\nI caught a glimpse of rushing \ufb01gures, and a moment\nlater the voice of Holmes from within assuring them\nthat it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shout-\ning crowd I made my way to the corner of the street,\nand in ten minutes was rejoiced to \ufb01nd my friend\u2019s\narm in mine, and to get away from the scene of up-\nroar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few\nminutes until we had turned down one of the quiet\nstreets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\n\u201cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,\u201d he remarked.\n\u201cNothing could have been better.

And into her sitting-\nroom, which was the very room which I suspected.\nIt lay between that and her bedroom, and I was de-\ntermined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I\nmotioned for air, they were compelled to open the\nwindow, and you had your chance.\u201d\n\u201cHow did that help you?\u201d\n\u201cIt was all-important. When a woman thinks that\nher house is on \ufb01re, her instinct is at once to rush\nto the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly\noverpowering impulse, and I have more than once\ntaken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington\nsubstitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in\nthe Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman\ngrabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her\njewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of\nto-day had nothing in the house more precious to\nher than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\nsecure it. The alarm of \ufb01re was admirably done. The\nsmoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of\nsteel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is\nin a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught\na glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried\nout that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced\nat the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not\nseen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, es-\ncaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt\nto secure the photograph at once; but the coachman\nhad come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may\nruin all.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOur quest is practically \ufb01nished.

The furniture was scattered about in\nevery direction, with dismantled shelves and open\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them\nbefore her \ufb02ight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore\nback a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his\nhand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.

In the\npresent instance I am forced to admit that the facts\nare, to the best of my belief, unique.\u201d\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an ap-\npearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and\nwrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his\ngreatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement\ncolumn, with his head thrust forward and the paper\n\ufb02attened out upon his knee, I took a good look at\nthe man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my\ncompanion, to read the indications which might be\npresented by his dress or appearance.\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspec-\ntion. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average\ncommonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous,\nand slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\u2019s\ncheck trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, un-\nbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a\nheavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit\nof metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed\ntop-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled\nvelvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,\nlook as I would, there was nothing remarkable about\nthe man save his blazing red head, and the expression\nof extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 quick eye took in my occupa-\ntion, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed\nmy questioning glances. \u201cBeyond the obvious facts\nthat he has at some time done manual labour, that he\ntakes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been\nin China, and that he has done a considerable amount\nof writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\u201d\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his\nfore\ufb01nger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my com-\npanion.\n\u201cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know\nall that, Mr.", "source": "data/rag/raw/sherlock/adventure-of-sherlock-holmes.pdf"}

I have made a small study of tattoo marks and\nhave even contributed to the literature of the subject.\nThat trick of staining the \ufb01shes\u2019 scales of a delicate\npink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I\nsee a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain,\nthe matter becomes even more simple.\u201d\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \u201cWell, I never!\u201d\nsaid he. \u201cI thought at \ufb01rst that you had done some-\nthing clever, but I see that there was nothing in it,\nafter all.\u201d\n\u201cI begin to think, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I\nmake a mistake in explaining. \u2018Omne ignotum pro mag-\nni\ufb01co,\u2019you know, and my poor little reputation, such\nas it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid.

That is\nhis main fault, but on the whole he\u2019s a good worker.\nThere\u2019s no vice in him.\u201d\n\u201cHe is still with you, I presume?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.

As far as I can make out, the League\nwas founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah\nHopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was\nhimself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for\nall red-headed men; so when he died it was found\nthat he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of\ntrustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the\nproviding of easy berths to men whose hair is of that\ncolour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very\nlittle to do.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018there would be millions of red-\nheaded men who would apply.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Not so many as you might think,\u2019 he answered.\n\u2018You see it is really con\ufb01ned to Londoners, and to\ngrown men. This American had started from London\nwhen he was young, and he wanted to do the old\ntown a good turn.

Now, if\nyou cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk\nin; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while\nto put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few\nhundred pounds.\u2019\n\u201cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for\nyourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint,\nso that it seemed to me that if there was to be any\ncompetition in the matter I stood as good a chance\nas any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding\nseemed to know so much about it that I thought he\nmight prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up\nthe shutters for the day and to come right away with\nme. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut\nthe business up and started off for the address that\nwas given us in the advertisement.\n\u201cI never hope to see such a sight as that again,\nMr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every\nman who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped\ninto the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street\nwas choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\u2019s Court\nlooked like a coster\u2019s orange barrow. I should not\nhave thought there were so many in the whole coun-\ntry as were brought together by that single adver-\ntisement. Every shade of colour they were\u2014straw,\nlemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as\nSpaulding said, there were not many who had the\nreal vivid \ufb02ame-coloured tint. When I saw how many\nwere waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but\nSpaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could\nnot imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted\nuntil he got me through the crowd, and right up to\nthe steps which led to the of\ufb01ce. There was a double\nstream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and\nsome coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well\nas we could and soon found ourselves in the of\ufb01ce.\u201d\n\u201cYour experience has been a most entertaining\none,\u201d remarked Holmes as his client paused and re-\nfreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.", "source": "data/rag/raw/sherlock/adventure-of-sherlock-holmes.pdf"}

He said a few words to each candidate as he\ncame up, and then he always managed to \ufb01nd some\nfault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a\nvacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter,\nafter all. However, when our turn came the little man\nwas much more favourable to me than to any of the\nothers, and he closed the door as we entered, so that\nhe might have a private word with us.\n\u201c \u2018This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\u2019 said my assistant, \u2018and\nhe is willing to \ufb01ll a vacancy in the League.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018And he is admirably suited for it,\u2019 the other an-\nswered. \u2018He has every requirement. I cannot recall\nwhen I have seen anything so \ufb01ne.\u2019 He took a step\nbackward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at\nmy hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he\nplunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated\nme warmly on my success.\n\u201c \u2018It would be injustice to hesitate,\u2019 said he. \u2018You\nwill, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvi-\nous precaution.\u2019 With that he seized my hair in both\nhis hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\n\u2018There is water in your eyes,\u2019 said he as he released\nme. \u2018I perceive that all is as it should be.

At two\no\u2019clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon\nthe amount that I had written, and locked the door of\nthe of\ufb01ce after me.\n\u201cThis went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on\nSaturday the manager came in and planked down\nfour golden sovereigns for my week\u2019s work. It was\nthe same next week, and the same the week after. Ev-\nery morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon\nI left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to\ncoming in only once of a morning, and then, after a\ntime, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never\ndared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not\nsure when he might come, and the billet was such a\ngood one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk\nthe loss of it.\n\u201cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had\nwritten about Abbots and Archery and Armour and\nArchitecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence\nthat I might get on to the B\u2019s before very long. It cost\nme something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly\n\ufb01lled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly\nthe whole business came to an end.\u201d\n\u201cTo an end?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.

I did not know what to do.\nThen I called at the of\ufb01ces round, but none of them\nseemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went\nto the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\nground-\ufb02oor, and I asked him if he could tell me what\nhad become of the Red-headed League.

I observe that there is a good deal of Ger-\nman music on the programme, which is rather more\nto my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective,\nand I want to introspect. Come along!\u201d\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Alders-\ngate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square,\nthe scene of the singular story which we had listened\nto in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick\nhouses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure,\nwhere a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps\nof faded laurel-bushes made a hard \ufb01ght against a\nsmoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three\ngilt balls and a brown board with \u201cJabez Wilson\u201d\nin white letters, upon a corner house, announced\nthe place where our red-headed client carried on\nhis business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of\nit with his head on one side and looked it all over,\nwith his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.\nThen he walked slowly up the street, and then down\n24\nThe Red-Headed League\nagain to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses.\nFinally he returned to the pawnbroker\u2019s, and, hav-\ning thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his\nstick two or three times, he went up to the door and\nknocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking,\nclean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI only wished to ask\nyou how you would go from here to the Strand.\u201d\n\u201cThird right, fourth left,\u201d answered the assistant\npromptly, closing the door.\n\u201cSmart fellow, that,\u201d observed Holmes as we\nwalked away. \u201cHe is, in my judgment, the fourth\nsmartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure\nthat he has not a claim to be third.

We are spies in an enemy\u2019s country. We\nknow something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now\nexplore the parts which lie behind it.\u201d\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we\nturned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg\nSquare presented as great a contrast to it as the front\nof a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\narteries which conveyed the traf\ufb01c of the City to the\nnorth and west. The roadway was blocked with the\nimmense stream of commerce \ufb02owing in a double tide\ninward and outward, while the footpaths were black\nwith the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was dif\ufb01-\ncult to realise as we looked at the line of \ufb01ne shops\nand stately business premises that they really abutted\non the other side upon the faded and stagnant square\nwhich we had just quitted.\n\u201cLet me see,\u201d said Holmes, standing at the corner\nand glancing along the line, \u201cI should like just to re-\nmember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of\nmine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\nMortimer\u2019s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop,\nthe Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,\nthe Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\u2019s carriage-\nbuilding depot. That carries us right on to the other\nblock. And now, Doctor, we\u2019ve done our work, so it\u2019s\ntime we had some play.

All the afternoon he\nsat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happi-\nness, gently waving his long, thin \ufb01ngers in time to\nthe music, while his gently smiling face and his lan-\nguid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes\nthe sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to con-\nceive. In his singular character the dual nature alter-\nnately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and\nastuteness represented, as I have often thought, the\nreaction against the poetic and contemplative mood\nwhich occasionally predominated in him. The swing\nof his nature took him from extreme languor to de-\nvouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so\ntruly formidable as when, for days on end, he had\nbeen lounging in his armchair amid his improvisa-\ntions and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the\nlust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and\nthat his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the\nlevel of intuition, until those who were unacquainted\nwith his methods would look askance at him as on a\nman whose knowledge was not that of other mortals.\nWhen I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the\nmusic at St. James\u2019s Hall I felt that an evil time might\nbe coming upon those whom he had set himself to\nhunt down.\n\u201cYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\u201d he\nremarked as we emerged.\n\u201cYes, it would be as well.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I have some business to do which will take\nsome hours.

As I drove\nhome to my house in Kensington I thought over it\nall, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed\ncopier of the \u201cEncyclopaedia\u201d down to the visit to\nSaxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with\nwhich he had parted from me. What was this noctur-\nnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where\nwere we going, and what were we to do? I had the\nhint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbro-\nker\u2019s assistant was a formidable man\u2014a man who\nmight play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but\ngave it up in despair and set the matter aside until\nnight should bring an explanation.\nIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from\nhome and made my way across the Park, and so\nthrough Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms\nwere standing at the door, and as I entered the pas-\nsage I heard the sound of voices from above. On\nentering his room I found Holmes in animated con-\nversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as\nPeter Jones, the of\ufb01cial police agent, while the other\nwas a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat\nand oppressively respectable frock-coat.\n\u201cHa!

It is the \ufb01rst Saturday night for\nseven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rub-\nber.\u201d\n\u201cI think you will \ufb01nd,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes,\n\u201cthat you will play for a higher stake to-night than\nyou have ever done yet, and that the play will be more\nexciting.

If you two will take the\n\ufb01rst hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative dur-\ning the long drive and lay back in the cab humming\nthe tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We\nrattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\nuntil we emerged into Farrington Street.\n\u201cWe are close there now,\u201d my friend remarked.\n\u201cThis fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and\npersonally interested in the matter. I thought it as\nwell to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow,\nthough an absolute imbecile in his profession. He\nhas one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog\nand as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon\nanyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\u201d\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare\nin which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our\ncabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of\nMr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage\nand through a side door, which he opened for us.\nWithin there was a small corridor, which ended in a\nvery massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led\ndown a \ufb02ight of winding stone steps, which termi-\nnated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather\nstopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us\ndown a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after\n26\nThe Red-Headed League\nopening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which\nwas piled all round with crates and massive boxes.\n\u201cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\u201d Holmes\nremarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about\nhim.\n\u201cNor from below,\u201d said Mr. Merryweather, strik-\ning his stick upon the \ufb02ags which lined the \ufb02oor.\n\u201cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\u201d he remarked,\nlooking up in surprise.\n\u201cI must really ask", "source": "data/rag/raw/sherlock/adventure-of-sherlock-holmes.pdf"}

Might I beg that\nyou would have the goodness to sit down upon one\nof those boxes, and not to interfere?\u201d\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself\nupon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his\nface, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the \ufb02oor\nand, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to\nexamine minutely the cracks between the stones. A\nfew seconds suf\ufb01ced to satisfy him, for he sprang to\nhis feet again and put his glass in his pocket.\n\u201cWe have at least an hour before us,\u201d he remarked,\n\u201cfor they can hardly take any steps until the good\npawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a\nminute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\ntime they will have for their escape. We are at present,\nDoctor\u2014as no doubt you have divined\u2014in the cellar\nof the City branch of one of the principal London\nbanks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\nand he will explain to you that there are reasons why\nthe more daring criminals of London should take a\nconsiderable interest in this cellar at present.\u201d\n\u201cIt is our French gold,\u201d whispered the director.\n\u201cWe have had several warnings that an attempt might\nbe made upon it.\u201d\n\u201cYour French gold?\u201d\n\u201cYes. We had occasion some months ago to\nstrengthen our resources and borrowed for that pur-\npose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has\nbecome known that we have never had occasion to un-\npack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar.\nThe crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons\npacked between layers of lead foil.

I had brought a pack of cards in\nmy pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie\ncarr\u00b4ee, you might have your rubber after all. But I see\nthat the enemy\u2019s preparations have gone so far that\nwe cannot risk the presence of a light. And, \ufb01rst of\nall, we must choose our positions. These are daring\nmen, and though we shall take them at a disadvan-\ntage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal\nyourselves behind those. Then, when I \ufb02ash a light\nupon them, close in swiftly. If they \ufb01re, Watson, have\nno compunction about shooting them down.\u201d\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the\nwooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot\nthe slide across the front of his lantern and left us in\npitch darkness\u2014such an absolute darkness as I have\nnever before experienced. The smell of hot metal re-\nmained to assure us that the light was still there, ready\nto \ufb02ash out at a moment\u2019s notice. To me, with my\nnerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\nsomething depressing and subduing in the sudden\ngloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.\n\u201cThey have but one retreat,\u201d whispered Holmes.\n\u201cThat is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg\nSquare.

From my position I could look over the\ncase in the direction of the \ufb02oor. Suddenly my eyes\ncaught the glint of a light.\nAt \ufb01rst it was but a lurid spark upon the stone\npavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a\nyellow line, and then, without any warning or sound,\na gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre\nof the little area of light. For a minute or more the\nhand, with its writhing \ufb01ngers, protruded out of the\n27\nThe Red-Headed League\n\ufb02oor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it ap-\npeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid\nspark which marked a chink between the stones.\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary.\nWith a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white\nstones turned over upon its side and left a square,\ngaping hole, through which streamed the light of\na lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,\nboyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then,\nwith a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself\nshoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested\nupon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side\nof the hole and was hauling after him a companion,\nlithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a\nshock of very red hair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all clear,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHave you the chisel\nand the bags?

It was a curious\nway of managing it, but, really, it would be dif\ufb01cult to\nsuggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested\nto Clay\u2019s ingenious mind by the colour of his accom-\nplice\u2019s hair. The \u00a34 a week was a lure which must\ndraw him, and what was it to them, who were playing\nfor thousands? They put in the advertisement, one\nrogue has the temporary of\ufb01ce, the other rogue incites\nthe man to apply for it, and together they manage to\nsecure his absence every morning in the week. From\nthe time that I heard of the assistant having come for\nhalf wages, it was obvious to me that he had some\nstrong motive for securing the situation.\u201d\n\u201cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\u201d\n\u201cHad there been women in the house, I should\nhave suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however,\nwas out of the question. The man\u2019s business was a\nsmall one, and there was nothing in his house which\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and\nsuch an expenditure as they were at. It must, then,\nbe something out of the house. What could it be? I\nthought of the assistant\u2019s fondness for photography,\nand his trick of vanishing into the cellar.

His knees were what I\nwished to see. You must yourself have remarked how\nworn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of\nthose hours of burrowing. The only remaining point\nwas what they were burrowing for. I walked round\nthe corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted\non our friend\u2019s premises, and felt that I had solved\nmy problem. When you drove home after the concert\nI called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman\nof the bank directors, with the result that you have\nseen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how could you tell that they would make\ntheir attempt to-night?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cWell, when they closed their League of\ufb01ces that\nwas a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez\nWilson\u2019s presence\u2014in other words, that they had com-\npleted their tunnel. But it was essential that they\nshould use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the\nbullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them\nbetter than any other day, as it would give them two\ndays for their escape. For all these reasons I expected\nthem to come to-night.\u201d\n\u201cYou reasoned it out beautifully,\u201d I exclaimed in\nunfeigned admiration. \u201cIt is so long a chain, and yet\nevery link rings true.\u201d\n\u201cIt saved me from ennui,\u201d he answered, yawning.\n\u201cAlas!

We have in\nour police reports realism pushed to its extreme lim-\nits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither\nfascinating nor artistic.\u201d\n\u201cA certain selection and discretion must be used in\nproducing a realistic effect,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cThis\nis wanting in the police report, where more stress is\nlaid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate\nthan upon the details, which to an observer contain\nthe vital essence of the whole matter.

The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other\nwoman, and the conduct complained of was that he\nhad drifted into the habit of winding up every meal\nby taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his\nwife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to\noccur to the imagination of the average story-teller.\nTake a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I\nhave scored over you in your example.\u201d\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great\namethyst in the centre of the lid.

Looking over his shoul-\nder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood\na large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,\nand a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed\nhat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of De-\nvonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great\npanoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fash-\nion at our windows, while her body oscillated back-\nward and forward, and her \ufb01ngers \ufb01dgeted with her\nglove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the\nswimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the\nroad, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\n\u201cI have seen those symptoms before,\u201d said Holmes,\nthrowing his cigarette into the \ufb01re. \u201cOscillation upon\nthe pavement always means an affaire de coeur . She\nwould like advice, but is not sure that the matter is\n33\nA Case ofIdentity\nnot too delicate for communication. And yet even\nhere we may discriminate.

Perhaps I have trained my-\nself to see what others overlook. If not, why should\nyou come to consult me?\u201d\n\u201cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from\nMrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy\nwhen the police and everyone had given him up for\ndead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much\nfor me. I\u2019m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year\nin my own right, besides the little that I make by the\nmachine, and I would give it all to know what has\nbecome of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a\nhurry?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes, with his \ufb01nger-tips\ntogether and his eyes to the ceiling.\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vac-\nuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \u201cYes, I did bang\nout of the house,\u201d she said, \u201cfor it made me angry\nto see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank\u2014that\nis, my father\u2014took it all.

I call him father, though it\nsounds funny, too, for he is only \ufb01ve years and two\nmonths older than myself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your mother is alive?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\u2019t best\npleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon\nafter father\u2019s death, and a man who was nearly \ufb01fteen\nyears younger than herself. Father was a plumber in\nthe Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business\nbehind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy,\nthe foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made\nher sell the business, for he was very superior, being\na traveller in wines. They got \u00a34700 for the goodwill\nand interest, which wasn\u2019t near as much as father\ncould have got if he had been alive.\u201d\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient\nunder this rambling and inconsequential narrative,\nbut, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest\nconcentration of attention.\n\u201cYour own little income,\u201d he asked, \u201cdoes it come\nout of the business?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me\nby my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand\nstock, paying 41/2 per cent. Two thousand \ufb01ve hun-\ndred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch\nthe interest.\u201d\n\u201cYou interest me extremely,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAnd\nsince you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year,\nwith what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt\ntravel a little and indulge yourself in every way.

Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He\nnever did wish us to go anywhere. He would get\nquite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-\nschool treat.

Did he make\nno attempt to see you?\u201d\n\u201cWell, father was going off to France again in a\nweek, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be\nsafer and better not to see each other until he had\ngone. We could write in the meantime, and he used\nto write every day. I took the letters in in the morning,\nso there was no need for father to know.\u201d\n\u201cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the\n\ufb01rst walk that we took.

Can you remember any\nother little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\n\u201cHe was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would\nrather walk with me in the evening than in the day-\nlight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very\nretiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\ngentle. He\u2019d had the quinsy and swollen glands when\nhe was young, he told me, and it had left him with a\nweak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of\nspeech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and\nhe wore tinted glasses against the glare.\u201d\n\u201cWell, and what happened when Mr. Windibank,\nyour stepfather, returned to France?\u201d\n\u201cMr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and\nproposed that we should marry before father came\nback. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear,\nwith my hands on the Testament, that whatever hap-\npened I would always be true to him. Mother said\nhe was quite right to make me swear, and that it was\na sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour\nfrom the \ufb01rst and was even fonder of him than I was.\nThen, when they talked of marrying within the week,\nI began to ask about father; but they both said never\nto mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards,\nand mother said she would make it all right with him.\nI didn\u2019t quite like that, Mr. Holmes.

It was to be at St.\nSaviour\u2019s, near King\u2019s Cross, and we were to have\nbreakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer\ncame for us in a hansom, but as there were two of\nus he put us both into it and stepped himself into a\nfour-wheeler, which happened to be the only other\ncab in the street. We got to the church \ufb01rst, and when\nthe four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down\nfrom the box and looked there was no one there! The\ncabman said that he could not imagine what had be-\ncome of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\neyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have\nnever seen or heard anything since then to throw any\nlight upon what became of him.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have been very shame-\nfully treated,\u201d said Holmes.\n\u201cOh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave\nme so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that,\nwhatever happened, I was to be true; and that even\nif something quite unforeseen occurred to separate\nus, I was always to remember that I was pledged to\nhim, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or\nlater.

Her\nboots I didn\u2019t observe. She had small round, hang-\ning gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly\nwell-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together\nand chuckled.\n\u201c\u2019Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along\nwonderfully. You have really done very well indeed.\nIt is true that you have missed everything of impor-\ntance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\nhave a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general\nimpressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon\ndetails. My \ufb01rst glance is always at a woman\u2019s sleeve.\nIn a man it is perhaps better \ufb01rst to take the knee of\nthe trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush\nupon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for\nshowing traces. The double line a little above the\nwrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,\nwas beautifully de\ufb01ned. The sewing-machine, of the\nhand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left\narm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb,\ninstead of being right across the broadest part, as\nthis was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing\nthe dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I\nventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting,\nwhich seemed to surprise her.\u201d\n\u201cIt surprised me.\u201d\n\u201cBut, surely, it was obvious. I was then much sur-\nprised and interested on glancing down to observe\nthat, though the boots which she was wearing were\nnot unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the\none having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other\na plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower\nbuttons out of \ufb01ve, and the other at the \ufb01rst, third,\nand \ufb01fth. Now, when you see that a young lady, other-\nwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with\nodd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to\nsay that she came away in a hurry.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what else?\u201d I asked, keenly interested, as I\nalways was, by my", "source": "data/rag/raw/sherlock/adventure-of-sherlock-holmes.pdf"}

All this is amus-\ning, though rather elementary, but I must go back to\nbusiness, Watson. Would you mind reading me the\nadvertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\u201d\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\n\u201cMissing,\u201d it said, \u201con the morning of\nthe fourteenth, a gentleman named Hos-\nmer Angel. About \ufb01ve ft. seven in. in\nheight; strongly built, sallow complex-\nion, black hair, a little bald in the cen-\ntre, bushy, black side-whiskers and mous-\ntache; tinted glasses, slight in\ufb01rmity of\nspeech. Was dressed, when last seen,\nin black frock-coat faced with silk, black\nwaistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Har-\nris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over\nelastic-sided boots. Known to have been\nemployed in an of\ufb01ce in Leadenhall Street.\nAnybody bringing\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cAs to the letters,\u201d\nhe continued, glancing over them, \u201cthey are very com-\nmonplace.

A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes,\nwith the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid,\ntold me that he had spent his day in the chemical\nwork which was so dear to him.\n\u201cWell, have you solved it?\u201d I asked as I entered.\n\u201cYes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, the mystery!\u201d I cried.\n\u201cOh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been\nworking upon. There was never any mystery in the\nmatter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details\nare of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\u201d\n\u201cWho was he, then, and what was his object in\ndeserting Miss Sutherland?\u201d\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and\nHolmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we\nheard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the\ndoor.\n\u201cThis is the girl\u2019s stepfather, Mr. James\nWindibank,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe has written to me\nto say that he would be here at six.

Now her marriage would mean,\nof course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does\nher stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious\ncourse of keeping her at home and forbidding her to\nseek the company of people of her own age. But soon\nhe found that that would not answer forever. She\nbecame restive, insisted upon her rights, and \ufb01nally\nannounced her positive intention of going to a certain\nball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He\nconceives an idea more creditable to his head than to\nhis heart. With the connivance and assistance of his\nwife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes\nwith tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache\nand a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice\ninto an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on\naccount of the girl\u2019s short sight, he appears as Mr.\nHosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making\nlove himself.\u201d\n\u201cIt was only a joke at \ufb01rst,\u201d groaned our visitor.\n\u201cWe never thought that she would have been so car-\nried away.\u201d\n\u201cVery likely not. However that may be, the young\nlady was very decidedly carried away, and, having\nquite made up her mind that her stepfather was in\nFrance, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant\nentered her mind. She was \ufb02attered by the gentle-\nman\u2019s attentions, and the effect was increased by the\nloudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr.\nAngel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter\nshould be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect\nwere to be produced. There were meetings, and an\nengagement, which would \ufb01nally secure the girl\u2019s\naffections from turning towards anyone else. But the\ndeception could not be kept up forever.

Then the fact\nthat the two men were never together, but that the\none always appeared when the other was away, was\nsuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curi-\nous voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the\nbushy whiskers. My suspicions were all con\ufb01rmed\nby his peculiar action in typewriting his signature,\nwhich, of course, inferred that his handwriting was\nso familiar to her that she would recognise even the\nsmallest sample of it.

Turner was apparently\nthe richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but\nstill remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equal-\nity, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had\none son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only\ndaughter of the same age, but neither of them had\nwives living. They appear to have avoided the society\nof the neighbouring English families and to have led\nretired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of\nsport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of\nthe neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants\u2014a\nman and a girl. Turner had a considerable household,\nsome half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I\nhave been able to gather about the families. Now for\nthe facts.\n\u201cOn June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy\nleft his house at Hatherley about three in the after-\nnoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which\nis a small lake formed by the spreading out of the\nstream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He\nhad been out with his serving-man in the morning at\nRoss, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as\nhe had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\n\u201cFrom Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe\nPool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as\nhe passed over this ground. One was an old woman,\n43\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\nwhose name is not mentioned, and the other was\nWilliam Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of\nMr. Turner.

The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round,\nwith just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the\nedge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the\ndaughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley\nestate, was in one of the woods picking \ufb02owers. She\nstates that while she was there she saw, at the border\nof the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and\nhis son, and that they appeared to be having a violent\nquarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very\nstrong language to his son, and she saw the latter\nraise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was\nso frightened by their violence that she ran away and\ntold her mother when she reached home that she had\nleft the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe\nPool, and that she was afraid that they were going to\n\ufb01ght. She had hardly said the words when young Mr.\nMcCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he\nhad found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for\nthe help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited,\nwithout either his gun or his hat, and his right hand\nand sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh\nblood. On following him they found the dead body\nstretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The\nhead had been beaten in by repeated blows of some\nheavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\nmight very well have been in\ufb02icted by the butt-end\nof his son\u2019s gun, which was found lying on the grass\nwithin a few paces of the body. Under these circum-\nstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a\nverdict of \u2018wilful murder\u2019 having been returned at the\ninquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought\nbefore the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the\ncase to the next Assizes.

It must be confessed, however, that\nthe case looks exceedingly grave against the young\nman, and it is very possible that he is indeed the cul-\nprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood,\nhowever, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter\nof the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\ninnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom\nyou may recollect in connection with the Study in\nScarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade,\nbeing rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and\nhence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are \ufb02y-\ning westward at \ufb01fty miles an hour instead of quietly\ndigesting their breakfasts at home.\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said I, \u201cthat the facts are so obvious\nthat you will \ufb01nd little credit to be gained out of this\ncase.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvi-\nous fact,\u201d he answered, laughing. \u201cBesides, we may\nchance to hit upon some other obvious facts which\nmay have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade.\nYou know me too well to think that I am boasting\nwhen I say that I shall either con\ufb01rm or destroy his\ntheory by means which he is quite incapable of em-\nploying, or even of understanding.

I could not imagine a man\nof your habits looking at himself in an equal light\nand being satis\ufb01ed with such a result. I only quote\nthis as a trivial example of observation and inference.\nTherein lies my m\u00b4etier, and it is just possible that it\nmay be of some service in the investigation which lies\nbefore us. There are one or two minor points which\nwere brought out in the inquest, and which are worth\nconsidering.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\n\u201cIt appears that his arrest did not take place at\nonce, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the\n44\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\ninspector of constabulary informing him that he was\na prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This\nobservation of his had the natural effect of removing\nany traces of doubt which might have remained in\nthe minds of the coroner\u2019s jury.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a confession,\u201d I ejaculated.\n\u201cNo, for it was followed by a protestation of inno-\ncence.\u201d\n\u201cComing on the top of such a damning series of\nevents, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\u201d\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cit is the brightest\nrift which I can at present see in the clouds. However\ninnocent he might be, he could not be such an abso-\nlute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were\nvery black against him. Had he appeared surprised at\nhis own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should\nhave looked upon it as highly suspicious, because\nsuch surprise or anger would not be natural under\nthe circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best\npolicy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the\nsituation marks him as either an innocent man, or else\nas a man of considerable self-restraint and \ufb01rmness.\nAs to his remark about his deserts, it was also not un-\nnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead\nbody of his father, and that there is no doubt that\nhe had that very day so far forgotten his \ufb01lial duty\nas to bandy words with him, and even, according to\nthe little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\nhis hand as if to", "source": "data/rag/raw/sherlock/adventure-of-sherlock-holmes.pdf"}

I have\ndriven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\u2019t\ndo it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your\nwork knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon\nthat point. We have known each other since we were\nlittle children, and I know his faults as no one else\ndoes; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a \ufb02y. Such\na charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\u201d\n\u201cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\u201d said Sher-\nlock Holmes. \u201cYou may rely upon my doing all that I\ncan.\u201d\n\u201cBut you have read the evidence.

I know that he is right. James\nnever did it. And about his quarrel with his father,\nI am sure that the reason why he would not speak\nabout it to the coroner was because I was concerned\nin it.\u201d\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Holmes.\n\u201cIt is no time for me to hide anything. James and\nhis father had many disagreements about me. Mr. Mc-\nCarthy was very anxious that there should be a mar-\nriage between us. James and I have always loved each\nother as brother and sister; but of course he is young\nand has seen very little of life yet, and\u2014and\u2014well,\nhe naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet.\nSo there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one\nof them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d asked Holmes. \u201cWas he in\nfavour of such a union?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr.\nMcCarthy was in favour of it.\u201d A quick blush passed\nover her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his\nkeen, questioning glances at her.\n\u201cThank you for this information,\u201d said he. \u201cMay I\nsee your father if I call to-morrow?\u201d\n\u201cI am afraid the doctor won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\u201cThe doctor?\u201d\n\u201cYes, have you not heard? Poor father has never\nbeen strong for years back, but this has broken him\ndown completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr.\nWillows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous\nsystem is shattered.

It was something terrible and\ndeadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the\ninjuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I\nrang the bell and called for the weekly county paper,\nwhich contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In\nthe surgeon\u2019s deposition it was stated that the poste-\nrior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of\nthe occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow\nfrom a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my\nown head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck\nfrom behind. That was to some extent in favour of the\naccused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face\nwith his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for\nthe older man might have turned his back before the\nblow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\u2019\nattention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying ref-\nerence to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be\ndelirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not\ncommonly become delirious. No, it was more likely\nto be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But\nwhat could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to \ufb01nd\nsome possible explanation. And then the incident of\nthe grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were\ntrue the murderer must have dropped some part of\nhis dress, presumably his overcoat, in his \ufb02ight, and\nmust have had the hardihood to return and to carry\nit away at the instant when the son was kneeling with\nhis back turned not a dozen paces off.

This\nfellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some\ntwo years ago, when he was only a lad, and before\nhe really knew her, for she had been away \ufb01ve years\nat a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get\ninto the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry\nher at a registry of\ufb01ce? No one knows a word of\nthe matter, but you can imagine how maddening it\nmust be to him to be upbraided for not doing what\nhe would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows\nto be absolutely impossible.

I think\nthat that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy\nfor all that he has suffered.\u201d\n\u201cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\u201d\n\u201cAh! who? I would call your attention very partic-\nularly to two points. One is that the murdered man\nhad an appointment with someone at the pool, and\nthat the someone could not have been his son, for his\nson was away, and he did not know when he would\nreturn. The second is that the murdered man was\nheard to cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before he knew that his son had\nreturned. Those are the crucial points upon which\nthe case depends.

This business has had a very\nbad effect upon him. He was an old friend of Mc-\nCarthy\u2019s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him,\nfor I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm\nrent free.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed!

It is the more strange, since we know that\nTurner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter\ntold us as much. Do you not deduce something from\nthat?\u201d\n\u201cWe have got to the deductions and the infer-\nences,\u201d said Lestrade, winking at me. \u201cI \ufb01nd it hard\nenough to tackle facts, Holmes, without \ufb02ying away\nafter theories and fancies.\u201d\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Holmes demurely; \u201cyou do\n\ufb01nd it very hard to tackle the facts.\u201d\n\u201cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem\nto \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to get hold of,\u201d replied Lestrade with\nsome warmth.\n\u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat McCarthy senior met his death from Mc-\nCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are\nthe merest moonshine.\u201d\n\u201cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\u201d\nsaid Holmes, laughing. \u201cBut I am very much mis-\ntaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that is it.\u201d It was a widespread, comfortable-\nlooking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great\nyellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls.

Men who had only\nknown the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street\nwould have failed to recognise him. His face \ufb02ushed\nand darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard\nblack lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath\nthem with a steely glitter. His face was bent down-\nward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and\nthe veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy\nneck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely ani-\nmal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely\nconcentrated upon the matter before him that a ques-\ntion or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the\nmost, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply.\nSwiftly and silently he made his way along the track\nwhich ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\nwoods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy\nground, as is all that district, and there were marks\nof many feet, both upon the path and amid the short\ngrass which bounded it on either side.

To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and\npeering eyes, very many other things were to be read\nupon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog\nwho is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my\ncompanion.\n\u201cWhat did you go into the pool for?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI \ufb01shed about with a rake. I thought there might\nbe some weapon or other trace. But how on earth\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of\nyours with its inward twist is all over the place.

That bears out his story. He ran when he saw\nhis father on the ground. Then here are the father\u2019s\nfeet as he paced up and down. What is this, then?

This\nis not such a populous neighbourhood.\u201d\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI am a practical\nman,\u201d he said, \u201cand I really cannot undertake to go\nabout the country looking for a left-handed gentleman\nwith a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock\nof Scotland Yard.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Holmes quietly. \u201cI have given\nyou the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I\nshall drop you a line before I leave.\u201d\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our\nhotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes\nwas silent and buried in thought with a pained ex-\npression upon his face, as one who \ufb01nds himself in a\nperplexing position.\n\u201cLook here, Watson,\u201d he said when the cloth was\ncleared \u201cjust sit down in this chair and let me preach\nto you for a little. I don\u2019t know quite what to do, and\nI should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me\nexpound.\u201d\n\u201cPray do so.\u201d\n\u201cWell, now, in considering this case there are\ntwo points about young McCarthy\u2019s narrative which\nstruck us both instantly, although they impressed me\nin his favour and you against him. One was the fact\nthat his father should, according to his account, cry\n\u2018Cooee!\u2019 before seeing him. The other was his singular\ndying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words,\nyou understand, but that was all that caught the son\u2019s\near.

There is a strong presumption\nthat the person whom McCarthy expected to meet\nhim at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in\nAustralia.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of the rat, then?\u201d\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his\npocket and \ufb02attened it out on the table. \u201cThis is a\nmap of the Colony of Victoria,\u201d he said. \u201cI wired to\nBristol for it last night.\u201d He put his hand over part of\nthe map. \u201cWhat do you read?\u201d\n\u201cARAT,\u201d I read.\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d He raised his hand.\n\u201cBALLARAT.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. That was the word the man uttered,\nand of which his son only caught the last two sylla-\nbles. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer.\nSo and so, of Ballarat.\u201d\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\u201cIt is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed\nthe \ufb01eld down considerably. The possession of a grey\ngarment was a third point which, granting the son\u2019s\nstatement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come\nnow out of mere vagueness to the de\ufb01nite conception\nof an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\u201cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the\npool can only be approached by the farm or by the\nestate, where strangers could hardly wander.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\n\u201cThen comes our expedition of to-day.

I found the ash of a\ncigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes\nenables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as\nyou know, devoted some attention to this, and writ-\nten a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different\nvarieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having\n51\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery\nfound the ash, I then looked round and discovered\nthe stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It\nwas an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in\nRotterdam.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the cigar-holder?\u201d\n\u201cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth.\nTherefore he used a holder.

He\nwas a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you\nout of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has\nbeen upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted\nmy life. I\u2019ll tell you \ufb01rst how I came to be in his\npower.\n\u201cIt was in the early \u201960\u2019s at the diggings. I was a\nyoung chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to\nturn my hand at anything; I got among bad compan-\nions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took\nto the bush, and in a word became what you would\ncall over here a highway robber. There were six of us,\nand we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station\nfrom time to time, or stopping the wagons on the\nroad to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the\nname I went under, and our party is still remembered\nin the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\n\u201cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat\nto Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it.\nThere were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close\nthing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the \ufb01rst\nvolley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before\nwe got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the\nwagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I\nwish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared\nhim, though I saw his wicked little eyes \ufb01xed on my\nface, as though to remember every feature.

I married,\ntoo, and though my wife died young she left me my\ndear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her\nwee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as\nnothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over\na new leaf and did my best to make up for the past.\nAll was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon\nme.\n\u201cI had gone up to town about an investment, and\nI met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his\nback or a boot to his foot.\n\u201c \u2018Here we are, Jack,\u2019 says he, touching me on the\narm; \u2018we\u2019ll be as good as a family to you.

If you don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a \ufb01ne, law-abiding country is\nEngland, and there\u2019s always a policeman within hail.\u2019\n\u201cWell, down they came to the west country, there\nwas no shaking them off, and there they have lived\nrent free on my best land ever since. There was no\nrest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where\nI would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my\nelbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon\nsaw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than\nof the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and\nwhatever it was I gave him without question, land,\nmoney, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I\ncould not give.

We were to\nmeet at the pool midway between our houses to talk\nit over.\n\u201cWhen I went down there I found him talking\nwith his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind\na tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to\nhis talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed\nto come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry\nmy daughter with as little regard for what she might\nthink as if she were a slut from off the streets. It\ndrove me mad to think that I and all that I held most\ndear should be in the power of such a man as this.\nCould I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and\na desperate man.

I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,\nI have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But\nthat my girl should be entangled in the same meshes\nwhich held me was more than I could suffer. I struck\nhim down with no more compunction than if he had\nbeen some foul and venomous beast.

About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe\nand took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He\nhad made a very considerable fortune in the States,\nand his reason for leaving them was his aversion to\nthe negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy\nin extending the franchise to them. He was a singular\nman, \ufb01erce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed\nwhen he was angry, and of a most retiring disposi-\ntion. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I\ndoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden\nand two or three \ufb01elds round his house, and there he\nwould take his exercise, though very often for weeks\non end he would never leave his room. He drank a\ngreat deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he\nwould see no society and did not want any friends,\nnot even his own brother.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me,\nfor at the time when he saw me \ufb01rst I was a young-\nster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878,\nafter he had been eight or nine years in England. He\nbegged my father to let me live with him and he was\nvery kind to me in his way. When he was sober he\nused to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts\nwith me, and he would make me his representative\nboth with the servants and with the tradespeople, so\nthat by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master\nof the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I\nliked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb\nhim in his privacy. There was one singular exception,\nhowever, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up\namong the attics, which was invariably locked, and\nwhich he would never permit either me or anyone\nelse to enter.

I began to laugh at this, but\nthe laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his\nface. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\nskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope\nwhich he still held in his trembling hand, \u2018K. K. K.!\u2019\nhe shrieked, and then, \u2018My God, my God, my sins\nhave overtaken me!\u2019\n\u201c \u2018What is it, uncle?\u2019 I cried.\n58\nThe Five Orange Pips\n\u201c \u2018Death,\u2019 said he, and rising from the table he re-\ntired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror.\nI took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink\nupon the inner \ufb02ap, just above the gum, the letter\nK three times repeated. There was nothing else save\nthe \ufb01ve dried pips. What could be the reason of his\noverpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as\nI ascended the stair I met him coming down with an\nold rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic,\nin one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in\nthe other.\n\u201c \u2018They may do what they like, but I\u2019ll checkmate\nthem still,\u2019 said he with an oath. \u2018Tell Mary that I\nshall want a \ufb01re in my room to-day, and send down\nto Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\u2019\n\u201cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived\nI was asked to step up to the room.

Kindly\nsign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\u2019\n\u201cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer\ntook it away with him. The singular incident made,\nas you may think, the deepest impression upon me,\nand I pondered over it and turned it every way in\nmy mind without being able to make anything of it.\nYet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread\nwhich it left behind, though the sensation grew less\nkeen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to\ndisturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a\nchange in my uncle, however. He drank more than\never, and he was less inclined for any sort of society.\nMost of his time he would spend in his room, with the\ndoor locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would\nemerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst\nout of the house and tear about the garden with a\nrevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid\nof no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like\na sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot\n\ufb01ts were over, however, he would rush tumultuously\nin at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like\na man who can brazen it out no longer against the\nterror which lies at the roots of his soul.

We found him, when\nwe went to search for him, face downward in a lit-\ntle green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the\ngarden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\nwater was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having\nregard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict\nof \u2018suicide.\u2019 But I, who knew how he winced from\nthe very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The\nmatter passed, however, and my father entered into\npossession of the estate, and of some \u00a314,000, which\nlay to his credit at the bank.\u201d\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Holmes interposed, \u201cyour state-\nment is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to\nwhich I have ever listened. Let me have the date of\nthe reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date\nof his supposed suicide.\u201d\n\u201cThe letter arrived on March 10, 1883.

Pray proceed.\u201d\n\u201cWhen my father took over the Horsham property,\nhe, at my request, made a careful examination of the\nattic, which had been always locked up.

K. K.,\u2019 said\nI.\n\u201cHe looked inside the envelope. \u2018So it is,\u2019 he cried.\n\u2018Here are the very letters.

I went about, however, with a\nheart which was full of forebodings.\n\u201cOn the third day after the coming of the letter\nmy father went from home to visit an old friend of\nhis, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the\nforts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should\ngo, for it seemed to me that he was farther from dan-\nger when he was away from home. In that, however,\nI was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I\nreceived a telegram from the major, imploring me to\ncome at once. My father had fallen over one of the\ndeep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood,\nand was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hur-\nried to him, but he passed away without having ever\nrecovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears,\nbeen returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as\nthe country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a\nverdict of \u2018death from accidental causes.\u2019 Carefully\nas I examined every fact connected with his death, I\nwas unable to \ufb01nd anything which could suggest the\nidea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no\nfootmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having\nbeen seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you\nthat my mind was far from at ease, and that I was\nwell-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven\nround him.\n\u201cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance.\nYou will ask me why I did not dispose of it?

Who is this K. K. K., and\nwhy does he pursue this unhappy family?\u201d\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his\nelbows upon the arms of his chair, with his \ufb01nger-tips\ntogether. \u201cThe ideal reasoner,\u201d he remarked, \u201cwould,\nwhen he had once been shown a single fact in all\nits bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of\nevents which led up to it but also all the results which\nwould follow from it.

If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in the\nearly days of our friendship, de\ufb01ned my limits in a\nvery precise fashion.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, laughing. \u201cIt was a singular\ndocument. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were\nmarked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geol-\nogy profound as regards the mud-stains from any\nregion within \ufb01fty miles of town, chemistry eccen-\ntric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and\ncrime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swords-\nman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.\nThose, I think, were the main points of my analysis.\u201d\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \u201cWell,\u201d he said,\n\u201cI say now, as I said then, that a man should keep his\nlittle brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he\nis likely to use, and the rest he can put away in the\nlumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he\nwants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has\nbeen submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to\nmuster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the\nletter K of the \u2018American Encyclopaedia\u2019 which stands\nupon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us\nconsider the situation and see what may be deduced\nfrom it. In the \ufb01rst place, we may start with a strong\npresumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very\nstrong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of\nlife do not change all their habits and exchange will-\ningly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely\nlife of an English provincial town. His extreme love\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was\nin fear of someone or something, so we may assume\nas a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone\nor something which drove him from America. As\nto what it was he feared, we can only deduce that\nby considering the formidable letters which were re-\nceived by himself and his successors.

There can be\nno doubt that the probability\u2014the strong probabil-\nity\u2014is that the writer was on board of a ship. And\nnow let us consider another point. In the case of\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat\nand its ful\ufb01lment, in Dundee it was only some three\nor four days. Does that suggest anything?\u201d\n\u201cA greater distance to travel.\u201d\n\u201cBut the letter had also a greater distance to\ncome.\u201d\n\u201cThen I do not see the point.\u201d\n\u201cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in\nwhich the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as\nif they always send their singular warning or token be-\nfore them when starting upon their mission. You see\nhow quickly the deed followed the sign when it came\n62\nThe Five Orange Pips\nfrom Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry\nin a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon\nas their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks\nelapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented\nthe difference between the mail-boat which brought\nthe letter and the sailing vessel which brought the\nwriter.\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\n\u201cMore than that. It is probable. And now you see\nthe deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged\nyoung Openshaw to caution. The blow has always\nfallen at the end of the time which it would take the\nsenders to travel the distance. But this one comes\nfrom London, and therefore we cannot count upon\ndelay.\u201d\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhat can it mean, this\nrelentless persecution?\u201d\n\u201cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obvi-\nously of vital importance to the person or persons\nin the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that\nthere must be more than one of them. A single man\ncould not have carried out two deaths in such a way\nas to deceive a coroner\u2019s jury.

A name derived from the\nfanciful resemblance to the sound produced\nby cocking a ri\ufb02e. This terrible secret soci-\nety was formed by some ex-Confederate sol-\ndiers in the Southern states after the Civil\nWar, and it rapidly formed local branches in\ndifferent parts of the country, notably in Ten-\nnessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and\nFlorida. Its power was used for political pur-\nposes, principally for the terrorising of the\nnegro voters and the murdering and driving\nfrom the country of those who were opposed to\nits views. Its outrages were usually preceded\nby a warning sent to the marked man in some\nfantastic but generally recognised shape\u2014a\nsprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds\nor orange pips in others. On receiving this\nthe victim might either openly abjure his for-\nmer ways, or might \ufb02y from the country. If\nhe braved the matter out, death would unfail-\ningly come upon him, and usually in some\nstrange and unforeseen manner. So perfect\nwas the organisation of the society, and so\nsystematic its methods, that there is hardly\na case upon record where any man succeeded\nin braving it with impunity, or in which any\nof its outrages were traced home to the per-\npetrators. For some years the organisation\n\ufb02ourished in spite of the efforts of the United\nStates government and of the better classes of\nthe community in the South. Eventually, in\nthe year 1869, the movement rather suddenly\ncollapsed, although there have been sporadic\noutbreaks of the same sort since that date.\u2019", "source": "data/rag/raw/sherlock/adventure-of-sherlock-holmes.pdf"}

It may well have\nbeen cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and\nhis family have some of the more implacable spirits\nupon their track. You can understand that this regis-\nter and diary may implicate some of the \ufb01rst men in\nthe South, and that there may be many who will not\nsleep easy at night until it is recovered.\u201d\n\u201cThen the page we have seen\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIs such as we might expect.

Then there are successive\nentries that A and B cleared, or left the country, and\n\ufb01nally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result\nfor C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light\ninto this dark place, and I believe that the only chance\nyoung Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I\nhave told him. There is nothing more to be said or to\nbe done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let\nus try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather\nand the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men.\u201d\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was\nshining with a subdued brightness through the dim\nveil which hangs over the great city.

The night, however, was\nextremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite\nof the help of several passers-by, it was quite\nimpossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, how-\never, was given, and, by the aid of the water-\npolice, the body was eventually recovered. It\nproved to be that of a young gentleman whose\nname, as it appears from an envelope which\nwas found in his pocket, was John Openshaw,\nand whose residence is near Horsham. It is\nconjectured that he may have been hurrying\ndown to catch the last train from Waterloo\nStation, and that in his haste and the extreme\ndarkness he missed his path and walked over\nthe edge of one of the small landing-places for\nriver steamboats. The body exhibited no traces\nof violence, and there can be no doubt that the\ndeceased had been the victim of an unfortu-\nnate accident, which should have the effect of\ncalling the attention of the authorities to the\ncondition of the riverside landing-stages.\u201d\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more\ndepressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.\n\u201cThat hurts my pride, Watson,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt\nis a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride.

Out there fell\na cascade of children\u2019s bricks. It was the toy which he\nhad promised to bring home.\n\u201cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which\nthe cripple showed, made the inspector realise that\nthe matter was serious. The rooms were carefully\nexamined, and results all pointed to an abominable\ncrime. The front room was plainly furnished as a\nsitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which\nlooked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Be-\ntween the wharf and the bedroom window is a nar-\nrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at\nhigh tide with at least four and a half feet of water.\nThe bedroom window was a broad one and opened\nfrom below. On examination traces of blood were to\nbe seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered\ndrops were visible upon the wooden \ufb02oor of the bed-\nroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room\nwere all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the\nexception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat,\nand his watch\u2014all were there. There were no signs of\nviolence upon any of these garments, and there were\nno other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the\nwindow he must apparently have gone for no other\nexit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains\nupon the sill gave little promise that he could save\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very\nhighest at the moment of the tragedy.\n\u201cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be\nimmediately implicated in the matter.

His\n72\nThe Man with theTwisted Lip\nname is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one\nwhich is familiar to every man who goes much to\nthe City. He is a professional beggar, though in or-\nder to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a\nsmall trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down\nThreadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there\nis, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the\nwall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap,\nand as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity\ndescends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon\nthe pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow\nmore than once before ever I thought of making his\nprofessional acquaintance, and I have been surprised\nat the harvest which he has reaped in a short time.\nHis appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no\none can pass him without observing him. A shock of\norange hair, a pale face dis\ufb01gured by a horrible scar,\nwhich, by its contraction, has turned up the outer\nedge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of\nvery penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular\ncontrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out\nfrom amid the common crowd of mendicants and so,\ntoo, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to\nany piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the\npassers-by.

Surely your medical\nexperience would tell you, Watson, that weakness\nin one limb is often compensated for by exceptional\nstrength in the others.\u201d\n\u201cPray continue your narrative.\u201d\n\u201cMrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood\nupon the window, and she was escorted home in a\ncab by the police, as her presence could be of no help\nto them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who\nhad charge of the case, made a very careful exami-\nnation of the premises, but without \ufb01nding anything\nwhich threw any light upon the matter. One mistake\nhad been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he\nmight have communicated with his friend the Las-\ncar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was\nseized and searched, without anything being found\nwhich could incriminate him. There were, it is true,\nsome blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he\npointed to his ring-\ufb01nger, which had been cut near\nthe nail, and explained that the bleeding came from\nthere, adding that he had been to the window not\nlong before, and that the stains which had been ob-\nserved there came doubtless from the same source.\nHe denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville\nSt. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes\nin his room was as much a mystery to him as to the\npolice. As to Mrs. St. Clair\u2019s assertion that she had\nactually seen her husband at the window, he declared\nthat she must have been either mad or dreaming. He\nwas removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station,\nwhile the inspector remained upon the premises in\nthe hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\nclue.\n\u201cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the\nmud-bank what they had feared to \ufb01nd.

Every pocket\nstuffed with pennies and half-pennies\u2014 421 pennies\nand 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had\nnot been swept away by the tide. But a human body\nis a different matter. There is a \ufb01erce eddy between\nthe wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that\nthe weighted coat had remained when the stripped\nbody had been sucked away into the river.\u201d\n\u201cBut I understand that all the other clothes were\nfound in the room. Would the body be dressed in a\ncoat alone?\u201d\n\u201cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously\nenough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust\nNeville St. Clair through the window, there is no\nhuman eye which could have seen the deed. What\nwould he do then? It would of course instantly strike\nhim that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments.\nHe would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that\nit would swim and not sink. He has little time, for\nhe has heard the scuf\ufb02e downstairs when the wife\ntried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already\nheard from his Lascar confederate that the police are\nhurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be\nlost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has\naccumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs\nall the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the\npockets to make sure of the coat\u2019s sinking.

With these he constructed a sort of Eastern\ndivan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged,\nwith an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches\nlaid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp I\nsaw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his\nlips, his eyes \ufb01xed vacantly upon the corner of the\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent,\nmotionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set\naquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep,\nand so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\nto wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into\nthe apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the\nsmoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a\ndense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\nof shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\n\u201cAwake, Watson?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cGame for a morning drive?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\u201cThen dress.

Come on,\nmy boy, and we shall see whether it will not \ufb01t the\nlock.\u201d\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as pos-\nsible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In\nthe road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad\nstable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in,\nand away we dashed down the London Road. A few\ncountry carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to\nthe metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side\nwere as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\n\u201cIt has been in some points a singular case,\u201d said\nHolmes, \ufb02icking the horse on into a gallop. \u201cI confess\nthat I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to\nlearn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\u201d\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to\nlook sleepily from their windows as we drove through\n76\nThe Man with theTwisted Lip\nthe streets of the Surrey side.

Sherlock\nHolmes was well known to the force, and the two\nconstables at the door saluted him. One of them held\nthe horse\u2019s head while the other led us in.\n\u201cWho is on duty?\u201d asked Holmes.\n\u201cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\u201d A tall, stout of\ufb01-\ncial had come down the stone-\ufb02agged passage, in a\npeaked cap and frogged jacket. \u201cI wish to have a quiet\nword with you, Bradstreet.\u201d \u201cCertainly, Mr. Holmes.\nStep into my room here.\u201d It was a small, of\ufb01ce-like\nroom, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a tele-\nphone projecting from the wall.

But he is a dirty\nscoundrel.\u201d\n\u201cDirty?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his\nhands, and his face is as black as a tinker\u2019s. Well,\nwhen once his case has been settled, he will have a\nregular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you\nwould agree with me that he needed it.\u201d\n\u201cI should like to see him very much.\u201d\n\u201cWould you?

It was only by trying begging as an amateur\nthat I could get the facts upon which to base my arti-\ncles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the\nsecrets of making up, and had been famous in the\ngreen-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my\nattainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as\npitiable as possible I made a good scar and \ufb01xed one\nside of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of\n\ufb02esh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair,\nand an appropriate dress, I took my station in the\nbusiness part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller\nbut really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my\ntrade, and when I returned home in the evening I\nfound to my surprise that I had received no less than\n26s. 4d.\n\u201cI wrote my articles and thought little more of\nthe matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a\nfriend and had a writ served upon me for \u00a325. I was\nat my wit\u2019s end where to get the money, but a sudden\nidea came to me. I begged a fortnight\u2019s grace from\nthe creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,\nand spent the time in begging in the City under my\ndisguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid\nthe debt.\n\u201cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle\ndown to arduous work at \u00a32 a week when I knew that\nI could earn as much in a day by smearing my face\nwith a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\nsitting still.

This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid\nby me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret\nwas safe in his possession.\n\u201cWell, very soon I found that I was saving con-\nsiderable sums of money. I do not mean that any\nbeggar in the streets of London could earn \u00a3700 a\nyear\u2014which is less than my average takings\u2014but I\nhad exceptional advantages in my power of making\nup, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved\nby practice and made me quite a recognised character\nin the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by\nsilver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day\nin which I failed to take \u00a32.\n\u201cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a\nhouse in the country, and eventually married, without\nanyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation.\nMy dear wife knew that I had business in the City.\nShe little knew what.\n\u201cLast Monday I had \ufb01nished for the day and was\ndressing in my room above the opium den when I\nlooked out of my window and saw, to my horror and\nastonishment, that my wife was standing in the street,\nwith her eyes \ufb01xed full upon me. I gave a cry of\nsurprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and,\nrushing to my con\ufb01dant, the Lascar, entreated him\nto prevent anyone from coming up to me.

Its owner is unknown. I beg\nthat you will look upon it not as a battered billycock\nbut as an intellectual problem. And, \ufb01rst, as to how\nit came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in\ncompany with a good fat goose, which is, I have no\ndoubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson\u2019s\n\ufb01re. The facts are these: about four o\u2019clock on Christ-\nmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very\nhonest fellow, was returning from some small jolli-\n\ufb01cation and was making his way homeward down\nTottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in the\ngaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger,\nand carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder.\nAs he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row\nbroke out between this stranger and a little knot of\nroughs.

It is true\nthat \u2018For Mrs. Henry Baker\u2019 was printed upon a small\ncard which was tied to the bird\u2019s left leg, and it is also\ntrue that the initials \u2018H. B.\u2019 are legible upon the lining\nof this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\nand some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of\nours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one\nof them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat, then, did Peterson do?\u201d\n\u201cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on\nChristmas morning, knowing that even the smallest\nproblems are of interest to me. The goose we retained\nuntil this morning, when there were signs that, in\nspite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should\nbe eaten without unnecessary delay. Its \ufb01nder has\ncarried it off, therefore, to ful\ufb01l the ultimate destiny\nof a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the\nunknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\u201d\n\u201cDid he not advertise?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n83\nThe Adventure of theBlue Carbuncle\n\u201cThen, what clue could you have as to his iden-\ntity?\u201d\n\u201cOnly as much as we can deduce.\u201d\n\u201cFrom his hat?\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\u201cBut you are joking.

You\nare too timid in drawing your inferences.\u201d\n\u201cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer\nfrom this hat?\u201d\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar\nintrospective fashion which was characteristic of him.\n\u201cIt is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,\u201d\nhe remarked, \u201cand yet there are a few inferences\nwhich are very distinct, and a few others which rep-\nresent at least a strong balance of probability. That\nthe man was highly intellectual is of course obvious\nupon the face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-\ndo within the last three years, although he has now\nfallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less\nnow than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression,\nwhich, when taken with the decline of his fortunes,\nseems to indicate some evil in\ufb02uence, probably drink,\nat work upon him. This may account also for the\nobvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\n\u201cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-\nrespect,\u201d he continued, disregarding my remon-\nstrance. \u201cHe is a man who leads a sedentary life,\ngoes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-\naged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within\nthe last few days, and which he anoints with lime-\ncream. These are the more patent facts which are to\nbe deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is\nextremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his\nhouse.\u201d\n\u201cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.\u201d\n\u201cNot in the least.

These \ufb02at brims curled\nat the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very best\nquality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the ex-\ncellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so\nexpensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat\nsince, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that is clear enough, certainly. But how\nabout the foresight and the moral retrogression?\u201d\nSherlock Holmes laughed. \u201cHere is the foresight,\u201d\nsaid he putting his \ufb01nger upon the little disc and loop\nof the hat-securer. \u201cThey are never sold upon hats. If\nthis man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount\nof foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\nprecaution against the wind. But since we see that he\nhas broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace\nit, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than\nformerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening\nnature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to\nconceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing\nthem with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely\nlost his self-respect.\u201d\n\u201cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\u201d\n\u201cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that\nhis hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and\nthat he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a\nclose examination of the lower part of the lining.

He\nhad remained with Horner some little time,\nbut had \ufb01nally been called away.

Ryder instantly gave\nthe alarm, and Horner was arrested the same\n85\nThe Adventure of theBlue Carbuncle\nevening; but the stone could not be found ei-\nther upon his person or in his rooms.

But will he see it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers,\nsince, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He\nwas clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking\nthe window and by the approach of Peterson that he\nthought of nothing but \ufb02ight, but since then he must\nhave bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him\nto drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of\nhis name will cause him to see it, for everyone who\nknows him will direct his attention to it.

In spite of its youth, it\nhas already a sinister history.

No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will\ncon\ufb01ne my attentions to the excellent bird which I\nperceive upon the sideboard.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me\nwith a slight shrug of his shoulders.\n\u201cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,\u201d said\nhe. \u201cBy the way, would it bore you to tell me where\nyou got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl\nfancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown goose.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d said Baker, who had risen and\ntucked his newly gained property under his arm.\n\u201cThere are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn,\nnear the Museum\u2014we are to be found in the Mu-\nseum itself during the day, you understand. This\nyear our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a\ngoose club, by which, on consideration of some few\npence every week, we were each to receive a bird at\nChristmas.

All\nthe way there every man I met seemed to me to be a\npoliceman or a detective; and, for all that it was a cold\nnight, the sweat was pouring down my face before I\ncame to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what\nwas the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her\nthat I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel.\nThen I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe\nand wondered what it would be best to do.\n90\nThe Adventure of theBlue Carbuncle\n\u201cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went\nto the bad, and has just been serving his time in Pen-\ntonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk\nabout the ways of thieves, and how they could get\nrid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true\nto me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I\nmade up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\nhe lived, and take him into my con\ufb01dence. He would\nshow me how to turn the stone into money. But how\nto get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had\ngone through in coming from the hotel. I might at\nany moment be seized and searched, and there would\nbe the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning\nagainst the wall at the time and looking at the geese\nwhich were waddling about round my feet, and sud-\ndenly an idea came into my head which showed me\nhow I could beat the best detective that ever lived.\n\u201cMy sister had told me some weeks before that\nI might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas\npresent, and I knew that she was always as good as\nher word. I would take my goose now, and in it I\nwould carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little\nshed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the\nbirds\u2014a \ufb01ne big one, white, with a barred tail.

Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot\nrecall any which presented more singular features\nthan that which was associated with the well-known\nSurrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my as-\nsociation with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms\nas bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might\nhave placed them upon record before, but a promise\nof secrecy was made at the time, from which I have\nonly been freed during the last month by the untimely\ndeath of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It\nis perhaps as well that the facts should now come\nto light, for I have reasons to know that there are\nwidespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby\nRoylott which tend to make the matter even more\nterrible than the truth.\nIt was early in April in the year \u2019 83 that I woke\none morning to \ufb01nd Sherlock Holmes standing, fully\ndressed, by the side of my bed.

A lady dressed in black and heavily\nveiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as\nwe entered.\n\u201cGood-morning, madam,\u201d said Holmes cheerily.\n\u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes.

The last squire dragged out his existence there,\nliving the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but\nhis only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt\nhimself to the new conditions, obtained an advance\nfrom a relative, which enabled him to take a medical\ndegree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his profes-\nsional skill and his force of character, he established\na large practice. In a \ufb01t of anger, however, caused by\nsome robberies which had been perpetrated in the\nhouse, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly\nescaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a\nlong term of imprisonment and afterwards returned\nto England a morose and disappointed man.\n\u201cWhen Dr. Roylott was in India he married my\nmother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-\nGeneral Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years\nold at the time of my mother\u2019s re-marriage. She had\na considerable sum of money\u2014not less than \u00a31000 a\nyear\u2014and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a\ncertain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in\nthe event of our marriage.

Violence\nof temper approaching to mania has been hereditary\nin the men of the family, and in my stepfather\u2019s case\nit had, I believe, been intensi\ufb01ed by his long residence\nin the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took\nplace, two of which ended in the police-court, until at\nlast he became the terror of the village, and the folks\nwould \ufb02y at his approach, for he is a man of immense\nstrength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\n\u201cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a\nparapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over\nall the money which I could gather together that I\nwas able to avert another public exposure. He had\nno friends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he\nwould give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon\nthe few acres of bramble-covered land which repre-\nsent the family estate, and would accept in return the\n96\nThe Adventure of theSpeckled Band\nhospitality of their tents, wandering away with them\nsometimes for weeks on end.

The manor-\nhouse is, as I have already said, very old, and only one\nwing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing\nare on the ground \ufb02oor, the sitting-rooms being in the\ncentral block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the\n\ufb01rst is Dr. Roylott\u2019s, the second my sister\u2019s, and the\nthird my own. There is no communication between\nthem, but they all open out into the same corridor.\nDo I make myself plain?\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly so.\u201d\n\u201cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon\nthe lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his\nroom early, though we knew that he had not retired\nto rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of\nthe strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to\nsmoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into\nmine, where she sat for some time, chatting about\nher approaching wedding.

We had no feeling of\nsecurity unless our doors were locked.\u201d\n\u201cQuite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\u201d\n\u201cI could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of\nimpending misfortune impressed me. My sister and\nI, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how\nsubtle are the links which bind two souls which are\nso closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was\nhowling outside, and the rain was beating and splash-\ning against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream\nof a terri\ufb01ed woman. I knew that it was my sister\u2019s\nvoice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round\nme, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister\ndescribed, and a few moments later a clanging sound,\nas if a mass of metal had fallen.

I ran to her and threw my\narms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed\nto give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as\none who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dread-\nfully convulsed. At \ufb01rst I thought that she had not\nrecognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly\nshrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, \u2018Oh,\nmy God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!\u2019\nThere was something else which she would fain have\nsaid, and she stabbed with her \ufb01nger into the air in\nthe direction of the doctor\u2019s room, but a fresh con-\nvulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed\nout, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him\nhastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When\nhe reached my sister\u2019s side she was unconscious, and\nthough he poured brandy down her throat and sent\nfor medical aid from the village, all efforts were in\nvain, for she slowly sank and died without having\nrecovered her consciousness.

The\nwalls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be\nquite solid all round, and the \ufb02ooring was also thor-\noughly examined, with the same result. The chimney\nis wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is\ncertain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\nshe met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any\nviolence upon her.\u201d\n\u201cHow about poison?\u201d\n\u201cThe doctors examined her for it, but without suc-\ncess.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady\ndied of, then?\u201d\n\u201cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and ner-\nvous shock, though what it was that frightened her I\ncannot imagine.\u201d\n\u201cWere there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\u201d\n\u201cYes, there are nearly always some there.\u201d\n\u201cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion\nto a band\u2014a speckled band?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the\nwild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have re-\nferred to some band of people, perhaps to these very\ngipsies in the plantation.

So\ntall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar\nof the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it\nacross from side to side. A large face, seared with a\nthousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and\nmarked with every evil passion, was turned from one\nto the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes,\nand his high, thin, \ufb02eshless nose, gave him somewhat\nthe resemblance to a \ufb01erce old bird of prey.\n\u201cWhich of you is Holmes?\u201d asked this apparition.\n\u201cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\u201d\nsaid my companion quietly.\n\u201cI am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, Doctor,\u201d said Holmes blandly. \u201cPray take\na seat.\u201d\n99\nThe Adventure of theSpeckled Band\n\u201cI will do nothing of the kind.

If he\nis violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\u2019s at\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time,\nso kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are\nto examine.\u201d\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone,\nwith a high central portion and two curving wings,\nlike the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In\none of these wings the windows were broken and\nblocked with wooden boards, while the roof was\npartly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central por-\ntion was in little better repair, but the right-hand\nblock was comparatively modern, and the blinds in\nthe windows, with the blue smoke curling up from\nthe chimneys, showed that this was where the family\nresided. Some scaffolding had been erected against\nthe end wall, and the stone-work had been broken\ninto, but there were no signs of any workmen at the\nmoment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and\ndown the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\nattention the outsides of the windows.\n\u201cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you\nused to sleep, the centre one to your sister\u2019s, and\nthe one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott\u2019s\nchamber?\u201d\n\u201cExactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle\none.\u201d\n\u201cPending the alterations, as I understand. By the\nway, there does not seem to be any very pressing need\nfor repairs at that end wall.\u201d\n\u201cThere were none. I believe that it was an excuse\nto move me from my room.\u201d\n\u201cAh! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side\nof this narrow wing runs the corridor from which\nthese three rooms open. There are windows in it, of\ncourse?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone\nto pass through.\u201d\n\u201cAs you both locked your doors at night, your\nrooms were unapproachable from that side. Now,\nwould you have the kindness to go into your room\nand bar your shutters?\u201d\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful\nexamination through the open window, endeavoured\nin every way to force the shutter open, but without\nsuccess. There was no slit through which a knife\ncould be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens\nhe tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built\n\ufb01rmly into the massive masonry. \u201cHum!\u201d said he,\nscratching his chin in some perplexity, \u201cmy theory\n", "source": "data/rag/raw/sherlock/adventure-of-sherlock-holmes.pdf"}

No one could\npass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall\nsee if the inside throws any light upon the matter.\u201d\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corri-\ndor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes\nrefused to examine the third chamber, so we passed\nat once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was\nnow sleeping, and in which her sister had met with\nher fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceil-\ning and a gaping \ufb01replace, after the fashion of old\ncountry-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in\none corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in an-\nother, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the\nwindow. These articles, with two small wicker-work\nchairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for\na square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards\nround and the panelling of the walls were of brown,\nworm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may\nhave dated from the original building of the house.\nHolmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\nsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and\nup and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.\n\u201cWhere does that bell communicate with?\u201d he\nasked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung\n101\nThe Adventure of theSpeckled Band\ndown beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon\nthe pillow.\n\u201cIt goes to the housekeeper\u2019s room.\u201d\n\u201cIt looks newer than the other things?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\u201cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I never heard of her using it.

Finally he took the\nbell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a dummy,\u201d said he.\n\u201cWon\u2019t it ring?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very\ninteresting. You can see now that it is fastened to\na hook just above where the little opening for the\nventilator is.\u201d\n\u201cHow very absurd! I never noticed that before.\u201d\n\u201cVery strange!\u201d muttered Holmes, pulling at the\nrope. \u201cThere are one or two very singular points\nabout this room. For example, what a fool a builder\nmust be to open a ventilator into another room, when,\nwith the same trouble, he might have communicated\nwith the outside air!\u201d\n\u201cThat is also quite modern,\u201d said the lady.\n\u201cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?\u201d re-\nmarked Holmes.\n\u201cYes, there were several little changes carried out\nabout that time.\u201d\n\u201cThey seem to have been of a most interesting\ncharacter\u2014dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which\ndo not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner,\nwe shall now carry our researches into the inner apart-\nment.\u201d\nDr. Grimesby Roylott\u2019s chamber was larger than\nthat of his step-daughter, but was as plainly fur-\nnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of\nbooks, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall,\na round table, and a large iron safe were the principal\nthings which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly\nround and examined each and all of them with the\nkeenest interest.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d he asked, tapping the safe.\n\u201cMy stepfather\u2019s business papers.\u201d\n\u201cOh! you have seen inside, then?\u201d\n\u201cOnly once, some years ago.

There is one point which\nI should wish to determine.\u201d He squatted down in\nfront of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it\nwith the greatest attention.\n\u201cThank you. That is quite settled,\u201d said he, rising\nand putting his lens in his pocket. \u201cHullo! Here is\nsomething interesting!\u201d\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small\ndog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The lash,\nhowever, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make\na loop of whipcord.\n\u201cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common enough lash. But I don\u2019t know\nwhy it should be tied.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it\u2019s a\nwicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains\nto crime it is the worst of all.

We had walked several\ntimes up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor\nmyself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he\nroused himself from his reverie.\n\u201cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,\u201d said he, \u201cthat\nyou should absolutely follow my advice in every re-\nspect.\u201d\n\u201cI shall most certainly do so.\u201d\n\u201cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation.

Twelve struck, and one and two and three,\nand still we sat waiting silently for whatever might\nbefall.\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a\nlight up in the direction of the ventilator, which van-\nished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong\nsmell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in\nthe next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gen-\ntle sound of movement, and then all was silent once\nmore, though the smell grew stronger.

On\nthe table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half\nopen, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron\nsafe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on\nthe wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a\nlong grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding\nbeneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turk-\nish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with\nthe long lash which we had noticed during the day.\nHis chin was cocked upward and his eyes were \ufb01xed\nin a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.\nRound his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with\nbrownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly\nround his head. As we entered he made neither sound\nnor motion.\n\u201cThe band! the speckled band!\u201d whispered\nHolmes.\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange\nheadgear began to move, and there reared itself from\namong his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and\npuffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n\u201cIt is a swamp adder!\u201d cried Holmes; \u201cthe dead-\nliest snake in India.

It is not necessary that I\nshould prolong a narrative which has already run to\ntoo great a length by telling how we broke the sad\nnews to the terri\ufb01ed girl, how we conveyed her by\nthe morning train to the care of her good aunt at Har-\nrow, of how the slow process of of\ufb01cial inquiry came\nto the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little\nwhich I had yet to learn of the case was told me by\nSherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.\n\u201cI had,\u201d said he, \u201ccome to an entirely erroneous\nconclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dan-\ngerous it always is to reason from insuf\ufb01cient data.\nThe presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\n\u2018band,\u2019 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt,\nto explain the appearance which she had caught a\nhurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were\nsuf\ufb01cient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered\nmy position when, however, it became clear to me\nthat whatever danger threatened an occupant of the\nroom could not come either from the window or the\ndoor. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have\nalready remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the\nbell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery\nthat this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped\nto the \ufb02oor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that\nthe rope was there as a bridge for something pass-\ning through the hole and coming to the bed.

The idea\nof using a form of poison which could not possibly\nbe discovered by any chemical test was just such a\none as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who\nhad had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which\nsuch a poison would take effect would also, from his\npoint of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-\neyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two\nlittle dark punctures which would show where the\npoison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of\nthe whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before\nthe morning light revealed it to the victim. He had\ntrained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\nsaw, to return to him when summoned. He would put\n105\nThe Adventure of theSpeckled Band\nit through this ventilator at the hour that he thought\nbest, with the certainty that it would crawl down the\nrope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite\nthe occupant, perhaps she might escape every night\nfor a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.\n\u201cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had\nentered his room. An inspection of his chair showed\nme that he had been in the habit of standing on it,\nwhich of course would be necessary in order that\nhe should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe,\nthe saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were\nenough to \ufb01nally dispel any doubts which may have\nremained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner\nwas obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing\nthe door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.

Of\nthese the latter may have afforded a \ufb01ner \ufb01eld for\nan acute and original observer, but the other was so\nstrange in its inception and so dramatic in its details\nthat it may be the more worthy of being placed upon\nrecord, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for\nthose deductive methods of reasoning by which he\nachieved such remarkable results. The story has, I\nbelieve, been told more than once in the newspapers,\nbut, like all such narratives, its effect is much less\nstriking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column\nof print than when the facts slowly evolve before your\nown eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as\neach new discovery furnishes a step which leads on\nto the complete truth. At the time the circumstances\nmade a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of\ntwo years has hardly served to weaken the effect.\nIt was in the summer of \u201989, not long after my mar-\nriage, that the events occurred which I am now about\nto summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had\n\ufb01nally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms,\nalthough I continually visited him and occasionally\neven persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so\nfar as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily\nincreased, and as I happened to live at no very great\ndistance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients\nfrom among the of\ufb01cials.

I was\nfortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit\nof fuller\u2019s-earth in one of my \ufb01elds. On examining\nit, however, I found that this deposit was a compara-\ntively small one, and that it formed a link between two\nvery much larger ones upon the right and left\u2014both\nof them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours.\nThese good people were absolutely ignorant that their\nland contained that which was quite as valuable as\na gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy\ntheir land before they discovered its true value, but\nunfortunately I had no capital by which I could do\nthis. I took a few of my friends into the secret, how-\never, and they suggested that we should quietly and\nsecretly work our own little deposit and that in this\nway we should earn the money which would enable\nus to buy the neighbouring \ufb01elds. This we have now\nbeen doing for some time, and in order to help us\nin our operations we erected a hydraulic press.

Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was\nonly seven miles, but I should think, from the rate\nthat we seemed to go, and from the time that we took,\nthat it must have been nearer twelve.

The instant that I had crossed the thresh-\nold the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard\nfaintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove\naway.\n\u201cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the\ncolonel fumbled about looking for matches and mut-\ntering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at\nthe other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar\nof light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and\na woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which\nshe held above her head, pushing her face forward\nand peering at us. I could see that she was pretty,\nand from the gloss with which the light shone upon\nher dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She\nspoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as\nthough asking a question, and when my companion\nanswered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a\nstart that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel\nStark went up to her, whispered something in her\near, and then, pushing her back into the room from\nwhence she had come, he walked towards me again\nwith the lamp in his hand.\n\u201c \u2018Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in\nthis room for a few minutes,\u2019 said he, throwing open\nanother door.

It was a wonderfully silent house.\nThere was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in\nthe passage, but otherwise everything was deadly\nstill. A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal\nover me. Who were these German people, and what\nwere they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way\nplace? And where was the place? I was ten miles or so\nfrom Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north,\nsouth, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter,\nReading, and possibly other large towns, were within\nthat radius, so the place might not be so secluded,\nafter all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute\nstillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and\ndown the room, humming a tune under my breath to\nkeep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly\nearning my \ufb01fty-guinea fee.\n\u201cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the\nmidst of the utter stillness, the door of my room\nswung slowly open. The woman was standing in\nthe aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\nyellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager\nand beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she\nwas sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my\nown heart. She held up one shaking \ufb01nger to warn\nme to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words\nof broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like\nthose of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind\nher.\n\u201c \u2018I would go,\u2019 said she, trying hard, as it seemed\nto me, to speak calmly; \u2018I would go.

It was\na labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages,\nnarrow winding staircases, and little low doors, the\nthresholds of which were hollowed out by the gen-\nerations who had crossed them. There were no car-\npets and no signs of any furniture above the ground\n\ufb02oor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and\nthe damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy\nblotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as\npossible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the\nlady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a\nkeen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson ap-\npeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could\nsee from the little that he said that he was at least a\nfellow-countryman.\n\u201cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a\nlow door, which he unlocked. Within was a small,\nsquare room, in which the three of us could hardly\nget at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\ncolonel ushered me in.\n\u201c \u2018We are now,\u2019 said he, \u2018actually within the hy-\ndraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleas-\nant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on.

It was indeed a gigantic\none, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.\nWhen I passed outside, however, and pressed down\nthe levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the\nwhishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which\nallowed a regurgitation of water through one of the\nside cylinders. An examination showed that one of\nthe india-rubber bands which was round the head of\na driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to \ufb01ll the\nsocket along which it worked. This was clearly the\ncause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\ncompanions, who followed my remarks very carefully\nand asked several practical questions as to how they\nshould proceed to set it right. When I had made it\nclear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own\ncuriosity. It was obvious at a glance that the story\nof the fuller\u2019s-earth was the merest fabrication, for\nit would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose.\nThe walls were of wood, but the \ufb02oor consisted of\na large iron trough, and when I came to examine it\nI could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\nhad stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly\nwhat it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in\n114\nThe Adventure of theEngineer\u2019s Thumb\nGerman and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel\nlooking down at me.\n\u201c \u2018What are you doing there?\u2019 he asked.\n\u201cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate\na story as that which he had told me. \u2018I was admiring\nyour fuller\u2019s-earth,\u2019 said I; \u2018I think that I should be\nbetter able to advise you as to your machine if I knew\nwhat the exact purpose was for which it was used.\u2019\n\u201cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted\nthe rashness of my speech.

He\nhad set the engine at work. The lamp still stood upon\nthe \ufb02oor where I had placed it when examining the\ntrough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was\ncoming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none\nknew better than myself, with a force which must\nwithin a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw\nmyself, screaming, against the door, and dragged\nwith my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to\nlet me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers\ndrowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two\nabove my head, and with my hand upraised I could\nfeel its hard, rough surface. Then it \ufb02ashed through\nmy mind that the pain of my death would depend\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay\non my face the weight would come upon my spine,\nand I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier\nthe other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie\nand look up at that deadly black shadow wavering\ndown upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect,\nwhen my eye caught something which brought a gush\nof hope back to my heart.\n\u201cI have said that though the \ufb02oor and ceiling were\nof iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a last hur-\nried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light\nbetween two of the boards, which broadened and\nbroadened as a small panel was pushed backward.\nFor an instant I could hardly believe that here was\nindeed a door which led away from death.

It was the same good friend\nwhose warning I had so foolishly rejected.\n\u201c \u2018Come! come!\u2019 she cried breathlessly. \u2018They will\nbe here in a moment.

Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but\ncome!\u2019\n\u201cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice.\nI staggered to my feet and ran with her along the\ncorridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to\nanother broad passage, and just as we reached it we\nheard the sound of running feet and the shouting of\ntwo voices, one answering the other from the \ufb02oor on\nwhich we were and from the one beneath.

I had been lying\nin an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and\njust a little lower down was a long building, which\nproved, upon my approaching it, to be the very sta-\ntion at which I had arrived upon the previous night.\nWere it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all\nthat had passed during those dreadful hours might\nhave been an evil dream.\n\u201cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked\nabout the morning train. There would be one to Read-\ning in less than an hour. The same porter was on\nduty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I\ninquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel\nLysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had\nhe observed a carriage the night before waiting for\nme? No, he had not. Was there a police-station any-\nwhere near? There was one about three miles off.\n\u201cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I\nwas. I determined to wait until I got back to town\nbefore telling my story to the police. It was a little\npast six when I arrived, so I went \ufb01rst to have my\nwound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough\nto bring me along here. I put the case into your hands\nand shall do exactly what you advise.\u201d\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after\nlistening to this extraordinary narrative.

It is quite clear that the colonel\nwas a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely\ndetermined that nothing should stand in the way of\nhis little game, like those out-and-out pirates who\nwill leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,\nevery moment now is precious, so if you feel equal\nto it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a\npreliminary to starting for Eyford.\u201d\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in\nthe train together, bound from Reading to the little\nBerkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the\nhydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland\nYard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet\nhad spread an ordnance map of the county out upon\nthe seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a\ncircle with Eyford for its centre.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d said he. \u201cThat circle is drawn at\na radius of ten miles from the village. The place we\nwant must be somewhere near that line. You said ten\nmiles, I think, sir.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an hour\u2019s good drive.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think that they brought you back all\nthat way when you were unconscious?\u201d\n\u201cThey must have done so. I have a confused mem-\nory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed some-\nwhere.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I cannot understand,\u201d said I, \u201cis why they\nshould have spared you when they found you lying\nfainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was soft-\nened by the woman\u2019s entreaties.\u201d\n\u201cI hardly think that likely.

We even\ntraced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther,\nfor they had covered their traces in a way that showed\nthat they were very old hands.

Large masses of nickel and of\ntin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no\ncoins were to be found, which may have explained\nthe presence of those bulky boxes which have been\nalready referred to.\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed\nfrom the garden to the spot where he recovered his\nsenses might have remained forever a mystery were\nit not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\ntale. He had evidently been carried down by two per-\nsons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the\nother unusually large ones.

I had remained indoors all day, for the weather\nhad taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autum-\nnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought\nback in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan\ncampaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my\nbody in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I\nhad surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers\nuntil at last, saturated with the news of the day, I\ntossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the\nhuge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon\nthe table and wondering lazily who my friend\u2019s noble\ncorrespondent could be.\n\u201cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\u201d I remarked\nas he entered. \u201cYour morning letters, if I remember\nright, were from a \ufb01sh-monger and a tide-waiter.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm\nof variety,\u201d he answered, smiling, \u201cand the humbler\nare usually the more interesting.

Ah, here it is:\n\u201c \u2018There will soon be a call for protection in\nthe marriage market, for the present free-trade\nprinciple appears to tell heavily against our\nhome product. One by one the management\nof the noble houses of Great Britain is pass-\ning into the hands of our fair cousins from\nacross the Atlantic. An important addition\nhas been made during the last week to the\nlist of the prizes which have been borne away\nby these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years\nproof against the little god\u2019s arrows, has now\nde\ufb01nitely announced his approaching mar-\nriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating\ndaughter of a California millionaire. Miss Do-\nran, whose graceful \ufb01gure and striking face at-\ntracted much attention at the Westbury House\nfestivities, is an only child, and it is currently\nreported that her dowry will run to consider-\nably over the six \ufb01gures, with expectancies for\nthe future. As it is an open secret that the\nDuke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell\nhis pictures within the last few years, and as\nLord St. Simon has no property of his own\nsave the small estate of Birchmoor, it is obvi-\nous that the Californian heiress is not the only\ngainer by an alliance which will enable her to\nmake the easy and common transition from a\nRepublican lady to a British peeress.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked Holmes, yawning.\n\u201cOh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in\nthe Morning Post to say that the marriage would\nbe an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St.\nGeorge\u2019s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen in-\ntimate friends would be invited, and that the party\nwould return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate\nwhich has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran.

It is headed, \u2018Singular Occurrence at a\nFashionable Wedding\u2019:\n\u201c \u2018The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has\nbeen thrown into the greatest consternation by\nthe strange and painful episodes which have\ntaken place in connection with his wedding.\nThe ceremony, as shortly announced in the\npapers of yesterday, occurred on the previous\nmorning; but it is only now that it has been\npossible to con\ufb01rm the strange rumours which\nhave been so persistently \ufb02oating about. In\nspite of the attempts of the friends to hush the\n122\nThe Adventure of theNoble Bachelor\nmatter up, so much public attention has now\nbeen drawn to it that no good purpose can be\nserved by affecting to disregard what is a com-\nmon subject for conversation.\n\u201c \u2018The ceremony, which was performed at St.\nGeorge\u2019s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet\none, no one being present save the father of\nthe bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of\nBalmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and\nLady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother\nand sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia\nWhittington.

The whole party proceeded af-\nterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran,\nat Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been\nprepared. It appears that some little trouble\nwas caused by a woman, whose name has not\nbeen ascertained, who endeavoured to force\nher way into the house after the bridal party,\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord\nSt. Simon. It was only after a painful and\nprolonged scene that she was ejected by the\nbutler and the footman. The bride, who had\nfortunately entered the house before this un-\npleasant interruption, had sat down to break-\nfast with the rest, when she complained of a\nsudden indisposition and retired to her room.\nHer prolonged absence having caused some\ncomment, her father followed her, but learned\nfrom her maid that she had only come up to\nher chamber for an instant, caught up an ul-\nster and bonnet, and hurried down to the pas-\nsage. One of the footmen declared that he had\nseen a lady leave the house thus apparelled,\nbut had refused to credit that it was his mis-\ntress, believing her to be with the company.\nOn ascertaining that his daughter had disap-\npeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction\nwith the bridegroom, instantly put themselves\nin communication with the police, and very\nenergetic inquiries are being made, which will\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this\nvery singular business. Up to a late hour last\nnight, however, nothing had transpired as to\nthe whereabouts of the missing lady. There\nare rumours of foul play in the matter, and\nit is said that the police have caused the ar-\nrest of the woman who had caused the origi-\nnal disturbance, in the belief that, from jeal-\nousy or some other motive, she may have been\nconcerned in the strange disappearance of the\nbride.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cAnd is that all?\u201d\n\u201cOnly one little item in another of the morning\npapers, but it is a suggestive one.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused\nthe disturbance, has actually been arrested.

A gentleman entered, with\na pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with\nsomething perhaps of petulance about the mouth,\nand with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose\npleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be\nobeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general\nappearance gave an undue impression of age, for he\nhad a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the\nknees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off\nhis very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the\nedges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was\ncareful to the verge of foppishness, with high col-\nlar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves,\npatent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He\nadvanced slowly into the room, turning his head from\nleft to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord\nwhich held his golden eyeglasses.\n\u201cGood-day, Lord St. Simon,\u201d said Holmes, rising\nand bowing. \u201cPray take the basket-chair.

That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,\nlooks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora\ndecoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for\nher.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it is a possible supposition.\u201d\n\u201cYou think so, too?\u201d\n\u201cI did not say a probable one.

Pray what is your own theory as to what took\nplace?\u201d\n\u201cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to pro-\npound one. I have given you all the facts. Since you\nask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to\nme as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social\nstride, had the effect of causing some little nervous\ndisturbance in my wife.\u201d\n\u201cIn short, that she had become suddenly de-\nranged?\u201d\n125\nThe Adventure of theNoble Bachelor\n\u201cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned\nher back\u2014I will not say upon me, but upon so much\nthat many have aspired to without success\u2014I can\nhardly explain it in any other fashion.\u201d\n\u201cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypoth-\nesis,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cAnd now, Lord St. Si-\nmon, I think that I have nearly all my data.

It was only a\nline asking me to join him when he made the sign to\nme to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\nthat my \ufb01rst duty was now to him, and I determined\nto do just whatever he might direct.\n\u201cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known\nhim in California, and had always been his friend. I\nordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things\npacked and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have\nspoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard\nbefore his mother and all those great people. I just\nmade up my mind to run away and explain after-\nwards. I hadn\u2019t been at the table ten minutes before\nI saw Frank out of the window at the other side of\nthe road. He beckoned to me and then began walking\ninto the Park.

It was\nawful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sit-\nting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to\ncome back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should\nnot be traced, and dropped them away somewhere\nwhere no one could \ufb01nd them. It is likely that we\nshould have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that\nthis good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us\nthis evening, though how he found us is more than I\ncan think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly\nthat I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that\nwe should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we\nwere so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance\nof talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came\nright away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert,\nyou have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have\ngiven you pain, and I hope that you do not think very\nmeanly of me.\u201d\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid\nattitude, but had listened with a frowning brow and\na compressed lip to this long narrative.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is not my custom\nto discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this\npublic manner.\u201d\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t forgive me?

Obviously something had occurred during the\nmorning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What\ncould that something be?

Then who could this American be, and\nwhy should he possess so much in\ufb02uence over her?\nIt might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young\nwomanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes\nand under strange conditions. So far I had got before\nI ever heard Lord St. Simon\u2019s narrative. When he told\nus of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride\u2019s\nmanner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a\nnote as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her\ncon\ufb01dential maid, and of her very signi\ufb01cant allusion\nto claim-jumping\u2014which in miners\u2019 parlance means\ntaking possession of that which another person has a\nprior claim to\u2014the whole situation became absolutely\nclear. She had gone off with a man, and the man\nwas either a lover or was a previous husband\u2014the\nchances being in favour of the latter.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how in the world did you \ufb01nd them?\u201d\n\u201cIt might have been dif\ufb01cult, but friend Lestrade\nheld information in his hands the value of which he\ndid not himself know. The initials were, of course, of\nthe highest importance, but more valuable still was it\nto know that within a week he had settled his bill at\none of the most select London hotels.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you deduce the select?\u201d\n\u201cBy the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and\neightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the\nmost expensive hotels. There are not many in London\nwhich charge at that rate.

He was dressed in a sombre\nyet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet\nhis actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of\nhis dress and features, for he was running hard, with\noccasional little springs, such as a weary man gives\nwho is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs.\nAs he ran he jerked his hands up and down, wag-\ngled his head, and writhed his face into the most\nextraordinary contortions.\n\u201cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\u201d\nI asked. \u201cHe is looking up at the numbers of the\nhouses.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that he is coming here,\u201d said Holmes,\nrubbing his hands.\n\u201cHere?\u201d\n\u201cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me\nprofessionally. I think that I recognise the symptoms.\nHa! did I not tell you?\u201d As he spoke, the man, puff-\ning and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at\nour bell until the whole house resounded with the\nclanging.\nA few moments later he was in our room, still\npuf\ufb01ng, still gesticulating, but with so \ufb01xed a look\nof grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were\nturned in an instant to horror and pity. For a while\nhe could not get his words out, but swayed his body\nand plucked at his hair like one who has been driven\nto the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly\nspringing to his feet, he beat his head against the wall\nwith such force that we both rushed upon him and\ntore him away to the centre of the room.

Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\nhas only been in my service a few months. She came\nwith an excellent character, however, and has always\ngiven me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has\nattracted admirers who have occasionally hung about\nthe place. That is the only drawback which we have\nfound to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly\ngood girl in every way.\n\u201cSo much for the servants. My family itself is so\nsmall that it will not take me long to describe it. I am\na widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been\na disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes\u2014a grievous dis-\nappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to\nblame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very\nlikely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he\nwas all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile\nfade even for a moment from his face. I have never\ndenied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better\nfor both of us had I been sterner, but I meant it for\nthe best.\n\u201cIt was naturally my intention that he should suc-\nceed me in my business, but he was not of a business\nturn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth,\nI could not trust him in the handling of large sums of\nmoney.

He is older than Arthur, a\nman of the world to his \ufb01nger-tips, one who had been\neverywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and\na man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of\nhim in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his\npresence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and\nthe look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one\nwho should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,\ntoo, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\u2019s quick\ninsight into character.\n\u201cAnd now there is only she to be described. She\nis my niece; but when my brother died \ufb01ve years ago\nand left her alone in the world I adopted her, and\nhave looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She\nis a sunbeam in my house\u2014sweet, loving, beautiful,\na wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender\nand quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my\nright hand. I do not know what I could do without\nher. In only one matter has she ever gone against my\nwishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for\nhe loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused\nhim. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into\nthe right path it would have been she, and that his\nmarriage might have changed his whole life; but now,\nalas! it is too late\u2014forever too late!\n\u201cNow, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who\nlive under my roof, and I shall continue with my\nmiserable story.\n\u201cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room\nthat night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my\nexperience, and of the precious treasure which we\nhad under our roof, suppressing only the name of\nmy client.

I am not a very\nheavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no\ndoubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two\nin the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound\nin the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake,\nbut it had left an impression behind it as though a\nwindow had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening\nwith all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a\ndistinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next\nroom. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,\nand peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\ndoor.\n\u201c \u2018Arthur!\u2019 I screamed, \u2018you villain! you thief!\nHow dare you touch that coronet?\u2019\n\u201cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my un-\nhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was\nstanding beside the light, holding the coronet in his\nhands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\nit with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from\nhis grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it\nup and examined it. One of the gold corners, with\nthree of the beryls in it, was missing.\n\u201c \u2018You blackguard!\u2019 I shouted, beside myself with\nrage. \u2018You have destroyed it!

Did\nI not see you trying to tear off another piece?\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You have called me names enough,\u2019 said he, \u2018I\nwill not stand it any longer. I shall not say another\nword about this business, since you have chosen to\ninsult me. I will leave your house in the morning and\nmake my own way in the world.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\u2019 I\ncried half-mad with grief and rage. \u2018I shall have this\nmatter probed to the bottom.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018You shall learn nothing from me,\u2019 said he with a\npassion such as I should not have thought was in his\nnature. \u2018If you choose to call the police, let the police\n\ufb01nd what they can.\u2019\n\u201cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had\nraised my voice in my anger.

He might avert it all if he\nwould but tell me what he had done with the three\nmissing stones.\n\u201c \u2018You may as well face the matter,\u2019 said I; \u2018you\nhave been caught in the act, and no confession could\nmake your guilt more heinous.

I\nsaw that he was too hardened for any words of mine\nto in\ufb02uence him. There was but one way for it. I\ncalled in the inspector and gave him into custody. A\nsearch was made at once not only of his person but\nof his room and of every portion of the house where\nhe could possibly have concealed the gems; but no\ntrace of them could be found, nor would the wretched\nboy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our\nthreats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and\nI, after going through all the police formalities, have\nhurried round to you to implore you to use your skill\nin unravelling the matter.

Sir George Burnwell\nhas been several times lately. No one else, I think.\u201d\n\u201cDo you go out much in society?\u201d\n\u201cArthur does. Mary and I stay at home.

Was\nthe remainder of the coronet at all injured?\u201d\n\u201cYes, it was twisted.\u201d\n\u201cDo you not think, then, that he might have been\ntrying to straighten it?\u201d\n\u201cGod bless you! You are doing what you can for\nhim and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was\nhe doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent,\nwhy did he not say so?\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not\ninvent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both\nways.

I ask you\nnow, is such a theory tenable?\u201d\n137\nThe Adventure of theBeryl Coronet\n\u201cBut what other is there?\u201d cried the banker with\na gesture of despair. \u201cIf his motives were innocent,\nwhy does he not explain them?\u201d\n\u201cIt is our task to \ufb01nd that out,\u201d replied Holmes;\n\u201cso now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for\nStreatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a\nlittle more closely into details.\u201d\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them\nin their expedition, which I was eager enough to do,\nfor my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred\nby the story to which we had listened. I confess that\nthe guilt of the banker\u2019s son appeared to me to be as\nobvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had\nsuch faith in Holmes\u2019 judgment that I felt that there\nmust be some grounds for hope as long as he was\ndissatis\ufb01ed with the accepted explanation. He hardly\nspoke a word the whole way out to the southern sub-\nurb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his\nhat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.\nOur client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the\nlittle glimpse of hope which had been presented to\nhim, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me\nover his business affairs.

A short railway journey and\na shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest\nresidence of the great \ufb01nancier.\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white\nstone, standing back a little from the road. A dou-\nble carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched\ndown in front to two large iron gates which closed\nthe entrance. On the right side was a small wooden\nthicket, which led into a narrow path between two\nneat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen\ndoor, and forming the tradesmen\u2019s entrance. On the\nleft ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not\nitself within the grounds at all, being a public, though\nlittle used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing\nat the door and walked slowly all round the house,\nacross the front, down the tradesmen\u2019s path, and\nso round by the garden behind into the stable lane.\nSo long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the\ndining-room and waited by the \ufb01re until he should\nreturn. We were sitting there in silence when the door\nopened and a young lady came in. She was rather\nabove the middle height, slim, with dark hair and\neyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute\npallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen\nsuch deadly paleness in a woman\u2019s face. Her lips, too,\nwere bloodless, but her eyes were \ufb02ushed with crying.\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me\nwith a greater sense of grief than the banker had done\nin the morning, and it was the more striking in her as\nshe was evidently a woman of strong character, with\nimmense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my\npresence, she went straight to her uncle and passed\nher hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.\n\u201cYou have given orders that Arthur should be\nliberated, have you not, dad?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to\nthe bottom.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am so sure that he is innocent.

Perhaps I had better take a look at\nthe lower windows before I go up.\u201d\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other,\npausing only at the large one which looked from the\nhall onto the stable lane.

Your niece, when you had, as she thought,\ngone to your room, slipped down and talked to her\nlover through the window which leads into the stable\nlane. His footmarks had pressed right through the\nsnow, so long had he stood there. She told him of\nthe coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the\nnews, and he bent her to his will.

In the middle of the\nnight he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose\nand, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin\nwalking very stealthily along the passage until she\ndisappeared into your dressing-room. Petri\ufb01ed with\nastonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and\nwaited there in the dark to see what would come of\nthis strange affair. Presently she emerged from the\nroom again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your\nson saw that she carried the precious coronet in her\nhands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain\nnear your door, whence he could see what passed in\nthe hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the win-\ndow, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom,\nand then closing it once more hurry back to her room,\npassing quite close to where he stood hid behind the\ncurtain.\n\u201cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take\nany action without a horrible exposure of the woman\nwhom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he\nrealised how crushing a misfortune this would be for\nyou, and how all-important it was to set it right. He\nrushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened\nthe window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down\nthe lane, where he could see a dark \ufb01gure in the\nmoonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but\nArthur caught him, and there was a struggle between\nthem, your lad tugging at one side of the coronet, and\nhis opponent at the other.

Just beyond it, however, at the far side\nof the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked\nwith a man, whose round impressions on one side\nshowed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell\nthat they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe\nand light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a\nlittle, and then had gone away. I thought at the time\nthat this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\nwhom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry\nshowed it was so. I passed round the garden without\nseeing anything more than random tracks, which I\ntook to be the police; but when I got into the stable\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the\nsnow in front of me.\n\u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted\nman, and a second double line which I saw with de-\nlight belonged to a man with naked feet.

I was at once\nconvinced from what you had told me that the latter\nwas your son. The \ufb01rst had walked both ways, but the\nother had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in\nplaces over the depression of the boot, it was obvious\nthat he had passed after the other. I followed them up\nand found they led to the hall window, where Boots\nhad worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I\nwalked to the other end, which was a hundred yards\nor more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\nround, where the snow was cut up as though there\nhad been a struggle, and, \ufb01nally, where a few drops of\nblood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken.\nBoots had then run down the lane, and another little\nsmudge of blood showed that it was he who had been\nhurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end,\nI found that the pavement had been cleared, so there\nwas an end to that clue.\n\u201cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as\nyou remember, the sill and framework of the hall\nwindow with my lens, and I could at once see that\nsomeone had passed out. I could distinguish the out-\nline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed\nin coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form\nan opinion as to what had occurred. A man had\nwaited outside the window; someone had brought\n142\nThe Adventure of theBeryl Coronet\nthe gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he\nhad pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they\nhad each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have ef-\nfected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a\nfragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was\nclear. The question now was, who was the man and\nwho was it brought him the coronet?\n\u201cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have\nexcluded the impossible, whatever remains, however\nimprobable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it\nwas not you who had brought it down, so there only\nremained your niece and the maids. But if it were\nthe maids, why should your son allow himself to be\naccused in their place?

When I remembered that you had seen her at\nthat window, and how she had fainted on seeing the\ncoronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.\n\u201cAnd who could it be who was her confederate?\nA lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the\nlove and gratitude which she must feel to you? I\nknew that you went out little, and that your circle of\nfriends was a very limited one. But among them was\nSir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as\nbeing a man of evil reputation among women. It must\nhave been he who wore those boots and retained the\nmissing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had\ndiscovered him, he might still \ufb02atter himself that he\nwas safe, for the lad could not say a word without\ncompromising his own family.\n\u201cWell, your own good sense will suggest what\nmeasures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer\nto Sir George\u2019s house, managed to pick up an acquain-\ntance with his valet, learned that his master had cut\nhis head the night before, and, \ufb01nally, at the expense\nof six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of\nhis cast-off shoes.

At last the little money\nwhich I had saved began to run short, and I was at\nmy wit\u2019s end as to what I should do.\n\u201cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in\nthe West End called Westaway\u2019s, and there I used to\ncall about once a week in order to see whether any-\nthing had turned up which might suit me. Westaway\nwas the name of the founder of the business, but it is\nreally managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own lit-\ntle of\ufb01ce, and the ladies who are seeking employment\nwait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by\none, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether\nshe has anything which would suit them.\n\u201cWell, when I called last week I was shown into\nthe little of\ufb01ce as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper\nwas not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very\nsmiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled\ndown in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her el-\nbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very\nearnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he\ngave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to\nMiss Stoper.\n\u201c \u2018That will do,\u2019 said he; \u2018I could not ask for any-\nthing better.

My wife is fond of a particu-\nlar shade of electric blue and would like\nyou to wear such a dress indoors in the\nmorning. You need not, however, go to the\nexpense of purchasing one, as we have one\nbelonging to my dear daughter Alice (now\nin Philadelphia), which would, I should\n149\nThe Adventure of theCopper Beeches\nthink, \ufb01t you very well. Then, as to sitting\nhere or there, or amusing yourself in any\nmanner indicated, that need cause you no\ninconvenience. As regards your hair, it\nis no doubt a pity, especially as I could\nnot help remarking its beauty during our\nshort interview, but I am afraid that I must\nremain \ufb01rm upon this point, and I only\nhope that the increased salary may recom-\npense you for the loss.

Why should they give\nyou \u00a3120 a year, when they could have their pick for\n\u00a340?

A fortnight went by, during which I\nfrequently found my thoughts turning in her direc-\ntion and wondering what strange side-alley of hu-\nman experience this lonely woman had strayed into.\nThe unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light\nduties, all pointed to something abnormal, though\nwhether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a\nphilanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my\npowers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that\nhe sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted\nbrows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter\naway with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.\n\u201cData! data! data!\u201d he cried impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t make\nbricks without clay.\u201d And yet he would always wind\nup by muttering that no sister of his should ever have\naccepted such a situation.\nThe telegram which we eventually received came\nlate one night just as I was thinking of turning in and\nHolmes was settling down to one of those all-night\nchemical researches which he frequently indulged in,\nwhen I would leave him stooping over a retort and a\ntest-tube at night and \ufb01nd him in the same position\nwhen I came down to breakfast in the morning.

Then perhaps I had\nbetter postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we\nmay need to be at our best in the morning.\u201d\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the next day we were well upon\nour way to the old English capital. Holmes had been\nburied in the morning papers all the way down, but\nafter we had passed the Hampshire border he threw\nthem down and began to admire the scenery. It was\nan ideal spring day, a light blue sky, \ufb02ecked with little\n\ufb02eecy white clouds drifting across from west to east.\nThe sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was\nan exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a\nman\u2019s energy. All over the countryside, away to the\nrolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey\nroofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the\nlight green of the new foliage.\n\u201cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\u201d I cried with all\nthe enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker\nStreet.\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\n\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat it is one of\nthe curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must\nlook at everything with reference to my own special\nsubject. You look at these scattered houses, and you\nare impressed by their beauty.

She has her freedom.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can be the matter, then? Can you suggest\nno explanation?\u201d\n\u201cI have devised seven separate explanations, each\nof which would cover the facts as far as we know\nthem. But which of these is correct can only be de-\ntermined by the fresh information which we shall no\ndoubt \ufb01nd waiting for us.

It is only fair to them to say that. But\n151\nThe Adventure of theCopper Beeches\nI cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my\nmind about them.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can you not understand?\u201d\n\u201cTheir reasons for their conduct. But you shall\nhave it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr.\nRucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart\nto the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully\nsituated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large\nsquare block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained\nand streaked with damp and bad weather. There are\ngrounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the\nfourth a \ufb01eld which slopes down to the Southampton\nhighroad, which curves past about a hundred yards\nfrom the front door. This ground in front belongs to\nthe house, but the woods all round are part of Lord\nSoutherton\u2019s preserves. A clump of copper beeches\nimmediately in front of the hall door has given its\nname to the place.\n\u201cI was driven over by my employer, who was\nas amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that\nevening to his wife and the child. There was no truth,\nMr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to\nbe probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Ru-\ncastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced\nwoman, much younger than her husband, not more\nthan thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less\nthan forty-\ufb01ve. From their conversation I have gath-\nered that they have been married about seven years,\nthat he was a widower, and that his only child by the\n\ufb01rst wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadel-\nphia.

As the daughter could\nnot have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine\nthat her position must have been uncomfortable with\nher father\u2019s young wife.\n\u201cMrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in\nmind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither\nfavourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It\nwas easy to see that she was passionately devoted\nboth to her husband and to her little son. Her light\ngrey eyes wandered continually from one to the other,\nnoting every little want and forestalling it if possible.\nHe was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion,\nand on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\nAnd yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She\nwould often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest\nlook upon her face. More than once I have surprised\nher in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was\nthe disposition of her child which weighed upon her\nmind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so\nill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age,\nwith a head which is quite disproportionately large.\nHis whole life appears to be spent in an alternation\nbetween savage \ufb01ts of passion and gloomy intervals\nof sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than\nhimself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and\nhe shows quite remarkable talent in planning the cap-\nture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would\nrather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and,\nindeed, he has little to do with my story.\u201d\n\u201cI am glad of all details,\u201d remarked my friend,\n\u201cwhether they seem to you to be relevant or not.\u201d\n\u201cI shall try not to miss anything of importance.\nThe one unpleasant thing about the house, which\nstruck me at once, was the appearance and conduct\nof the servants.

His wife is a very tall and strong\nwoman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle\nand much less amiable. They are a most unpleasant\ncouple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in\nthe nursery and my own room, which are next to each\nother in one corner of the building.\n\u201cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper\nBeeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs.\nRucastle came down just after breakfast and whis-\npered something to her husband.\n\u201c \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, turning to me, \u2018we are very\nmuch obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with\nour whims so far as to cut your hair.

It was of excellent material, a\nsort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having\nbeen worn before. It could not have been a better\n\ufb01t if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs.\nRucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which\nseemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They\nwere waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a\nvery large room, stretching along the entire front of\nthe house, with three long windows reaching down to\nthe \ufb02oor. A chair had been placed close to the central\nwindow, with its back turned towards it.

Mrs. Rucastle, how-\never, who has evidently no sense of humour, never\nso much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap,\nand a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour\nor so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was\ntime to commence the duties of the day, and that I\nmight change my dress and go to little Edward in the\nnursery.\n\u201cTwo days later this same performance was gone\nthrough under exactly similar circumstances. Again\nI changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and\nagain I laughed very heartily at the funny stories\nof which my employer had an immense r \u00b4epertoire,\nand which he told inimitably. Then he handed me\na yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\nsideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon\nthe page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read\nfor about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a\nchapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sen-\ntence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.\n\u201cYou can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious\nI became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary\nperformance could possibly be. They were always\nvery careful, I observed, to turn my face away from\nthe window, so that I became consumed with the de-\nsire to see what was going on behind my back. At\n\ufb01rst it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a\nmeans. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy\nthought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the\nglass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in\nthe midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up\nto my eyes, and was able with a little management\nto see all that there was behind me.

On the very \ufb01rst\nday that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle\ntook me to a small outhouse which stands near the\nkitchen door.

I call him mine, but really old Toller, my\ngroom, is the only man who can do anything with\nhim. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,\nso that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets\nhim loose every night, and God help the trespasser\nwhom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness\u2019 sake\ndon\u2019t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the\nthreshold at night, for it\u2019s as much as your life is\nworth.\u2019\n\u201cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later\nI happened to look out of my bedroom window about\ntwo o\u2019clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moon-\nlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\nsilvered over and almost as bright as day. I was stand-\ning, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when\nI was aware that something was moving under the\nshadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\nmoonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as\nlarge as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black\nmuzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly\nacross the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon\nthe other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to\n153\nThe Adventure of theCopper Beeches\nmy heart which I do not think that any burglar could\nhave done.\n\u201cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell\nyou. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London,\nand I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my\ntrunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began\nto amuse myself by examining the furniture of my\nroom and by rearranging my own little things. There\nwas an old chest of drawers in the room, the two\nupper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.

It struck me\nthat it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,\nso I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it.\nThe very \ufb01rst key \ufb01tted to perfection, and I drew the\ndrawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am\nsure that you would never guess what it was. It was\nmy coil of hair.\n\u201cI took it up and examined it. It was of the same\npeculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the\nimpossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me.\nHow could my hair have been locked in the drawer?\nWith trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out\nthe contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair.\nI laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that\nthey were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puz-\nzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what\nit meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,\nand I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I\nfelt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\ndrawer which they had locked.\n\u201cI am naturally observant, as you may have re-\nmarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good\nplan of the whole house in my head. There was one\nwing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at\nall. A door which faced that which led into the quar-\nters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was\ninvariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended\nthe stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this\ndoor, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face\nwhich made him a very different person to the round,\njovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks\nwere red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and\nthe veins stood out at his temples with passion. He\nlocked the door and hurried past me without a word\nor a look.\n\u201cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out\nfor a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled\nround to the side from which I could see the windows\nof this part of the house.

As I strolled up and down, glancing at them\noccasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\nmerry and jovial as ever.\n\u201c \u2018Ah!\u2019 said he, \u2018you must not think me rude if I\npassed you without a word, my dear young lady. I\nwas preoccupied with business matters.\u2019\n\u201cI assured him that I was not offended. \u2018By the\nway,\u2019 said I, \u2018you seem to have quite a suite of spare\nrooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.\u2019\n\u201cHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a\nlittle startled at my remark.\n\u201c \u2018Photography is one of my hobbies,\u2019 said he. \u2018I\nhave made my dark room up there. But, dear me!\nwhat an observant young lady we have come upon.\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever\nbelieved it?\u2019 He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was\nno jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion\nthere and annoyance, but no jest.\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I under-\nstood that there was something about that suite of\nrooms which I was not to know, I was all on \ufb01re to go\nover them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have\nmy share of that. It was more a feeling of duty\u2014a\nfeeling that some good might come from my pene-\ntrating to this place. They talk of woman\u2019s instinct;\nperhaps it was woman\u2019s instinct which gave me that\nfeeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly\non the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden\ndoor.\n\u201cIt was only yesterday that the chance came. I\nmay tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller\nand his wife \ufb01nd something to do in these deserted\nrooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black\nlinen bag with him through the door.

Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both down-\nstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an\nadmirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the\nlock, opened the door, and slipped through.\n\u201cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpa-\npered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle\nat the farther end. Round this corner were three doors\nin a line, the \ufb01rst and third of which were open. They\neach led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless,\nwith two windows in the one and one in the other, so\nthick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly\nthrough them. The centre door was closed, and across\nthe outside of it had been fastened one of the broad\nbars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring\n154\nThe Adventure of theCopper Beeches\nin the wall, and fastened at the other with stout cord.\nThe door itself was locked as well, and the key was\nnot there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly\nwith the shuttered window outside, and yet I could\nsee by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was\nnot in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which\nlet in light from above. As I stood in the passage\ngazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret\nit might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps\nwithin the room and saw a shadow pass backward\nand forward against the little slit of dim light which\nshone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning\nterror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My\noverstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned\nand ran\u2014ran as though some dreadful hand were\nbehind me clutching at the skirt of my dress.

I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she\ncould do nothing with him.\u201d\n\u201cThat is well.

We shall then look thoroughly into\nthe affair. Of course there is only one feasible expla-\nnation. You have been brought there to personate\nsomeone, and the real person is imprisoned in this\nchamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner\nis, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Al-\nice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to\nhave gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless,\nas resembling her in height, \ufb01gure, and the colour\nof your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in\nsome illness through which she has passed, and so, of\ncourse, yours had to be sacri\ufb01ced also. By a curious\nchance you came upon her tresses. The man in the\nroad was undoubtedly some friend of hers\u2014possibly\nher \ufb01anc \u00b4e\u2014and no doubt, as you wore the girl\u2019s dress\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your\nlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from\nyour gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy,\nand that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\nis let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring\nto communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The\nmost serious point in the case is the disposition of the\nchild.\u201d\n\u201cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\u201d I ejacu-\nlated.\n\u201cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are con-\ntinually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child\nby the study of the parents. Don\u2019t you see that the\nconverse is equally valid. I have frequently gained\nmy \ufb01rst real insight into the character of parents by\nstudying their children. This child\u2019s disposition is ab-\nnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\u2019s sake, and whether\nhe derives this from his smiling father, as I should\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor\ngirl who is in their power.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,\u201d cried\nour client. \u201cA thousand things come back to me\nwhich make me certain that you have hit it.

Holmes cut the cord and removed the trans-\nverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock,\nbut without success. No sound came from within,\nand at the silence Holmes\u2019 face clouded over.\n\u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he. \u201cI think,\nMiss Hunter, that we had better go in without you.\nNow, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall\nsee whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once be-\nfore our united strength.

Quick, quick, or\nit\u2019ll be too late!\u201d\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle\nof the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There\nwas the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried\nin Rucastle\u2019s throat, while he writhed and screamed\nupon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out,\nand it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting\nin the great creases of his neck. With much labour\nwe separated them and carried him, living but hor-\nribly mangled, into the house. We laid him upon\nthe drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the\nsobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what\nI could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled\nround him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt\nwoman entered the room.\n\u201cMrs. Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.\n\u201cYes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came\nback before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity\nyou didn\u2019t let me know what you were planning, for\nI would have told you that your pains were wasted.\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Holmes, looking keenly at her. \u201cIt is\nclear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this matter\nthan anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what\nI know.\u201d\n\u201cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there\nare several points on which I must confess that I am\nstill in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cI will soon make it clear to you,\u201d said she; \u201cand\nI\u2019d have done so before now if I could ha\u2019 got out\nfrom the cellar. If there\u2019s police-court business over\nthis, you\u2019ll remember that I was the one that stood\nyour friend, and that I was Miss Alice\u2019s friend too.\n\u201cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\u2019t,\nfrom the time that her father married again. She\nwas slighted like and had no say in anything, but it\nnever really became bad for her until after she met\nMr. Fowler at a friend\u2019s house. As well as I could\nlearn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but\nshe was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never\nsaid a word about them but just left everything in\nMr. Rucastle\u2019s hands.

He knew he was safe with her;\nbut when there was a chance of a husband coming\nforward, who would ask for all that the law would\ngive him, then her father thought it time to put a stop\non it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether\nshe married or not, he could use her money. When\nshe wouldn\u2019t do it, he kept on worrying her until she\ngot brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\u2019s door.\nThen she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and\nwith her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn\u2019t make\nno change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\ntrue as man could be.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that what you have\nbeen good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly\nclear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr.\nRucastle then, I presume, took to this system of im-\nprisonment?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in\norder to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr.\nFowler.\u201d\n\u201cThat was it, sir.\u201d\n\u201cBut Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a\ngood seaman should be, blockaded the house, and\nhaving met you succeeded by certain arguments,\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your\ninterests were the same as his.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed\ngentleman,\u201d said Mrs. Toller serenely.\n\u201cAnd in this way he managed that your good\nman should have no want of drink, and that a ladder\nshould be ready at the moment when your master\nhad gone out.\u201d\n\u201cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,\u201d\nsaid Holmes, \u201cfor you have certainly cleared up every-\nthing which puzzled us. And here comes the country\nsurgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that\nwe had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,\nas it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a\nquestionable one.\u201d\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister\nhouse with the copper beeches in front of the door.
